    "title": "AITA - Getting Hugged At The Bar",
    "body": " \n\nThis all happened less than an hour ago.\n\nI was at a bar I frequent and talking to some people I know, suddenly I feel someone from behind me hugging and starting to grind against me. I know a lot of people at the bar, and assume it's a friend of mine, but when I look down at the shoes I do not recognize them. I look back and I see a dude I do not know, nor have I ever seen. He looks back at me, with horror in his eyes, because I'm a dude too... I feel an urge of rage inside me and shove him in the chest with my elbow so I can get away.\n\nHe goes to his table and I go back to mine. I was with my roommate and his girlfriend. They asked what happened and I told them, then I see the guy who hugged me looking around for me. Him and two of his friends come up to us and he says:  \n\"I just wanted to apologize, I thought you were someone else.\"\n\nI respond, \"I understand, just check before you hug people. Now, please fuck off\"\n\nHe repeats his last statement, so do I. This happens one more time and at this point his friends have surrounded me, my roommate is on his feet and I have left my beer at the table. His friend goes in my face and says.  \n\"He just wanted to apologize, you really shouldn't be yelling at us\" and starts waiving his finger at me.\n\nWe are at a rock bar, it's loud, I was speaking louder just to be sure I am heard.\n\nThe manager knows me so he comes asking me what happened. I explain the situation and he speaks with them then he tells me.  \n\"They want to say sorry, can you guys shake hand?\"\n\n\"Yeah sure, I just want them to leave me alone.\"  \nHonestly I didn't even want to touch the guy, but whatever. We shake hands and they go away.\n\nMe and my roommate look at their table and there's no one that looks anything like me. So, reddit, did I overreact? Am I The Asshole here?",

    "body": "I was with my dad and driving the family car when I went to a gas station. I asked for $20 of 91. The attendant even repeated my request, and I said \"Yes, $20 91\". I paid cash, and the attendant went into the station to deal with the transaction. When he came out, I noticed he was putting the 89 gas nozzle into my car instead. I immediately tried to tell him that I paid for 91, but he wasn't paying attention. I yelled a bit louder and another employee (who looks like the manager) pulled the nozzle out. By that time, about $5 (give or take) of 89 had been pumped into the car. The manager went into the station to deal with the error, and started pumping 91. When it was finished, I was surprised I only got \\~$15 of 91. I told the manager, \"I wanted $20 of 91\", and he said, \"You paid for $20 of gas, and you got $20 of gas\". I said, \"But I didn't ask for 89. Your employee was the one who gave me something I didn't want. Why should I pay for someone else's mistake?\" We kept arguing back and forth for a minute or so, until my dad said let's go, since it was clear we were getting nowhere. AITA for wanting that $5 of 91, even though I did in fact get $20 worth of gas?\n\nEdited: for formatting\n\nEdit 2: I guess I should've noted that no one apologized for putting in the wrong gas, and the manager was very dismissive. It might not seem like a big deal to you, but my dad is the one who likes 91, and dislikes mixing different octane grade gas in the tank. Yes, employees are humans who make mistakes, and what's done is done, so I would've taken either an apology or $5 of 91.\n\nEdit 3: When I say argue, it's not like I yelled at the guy. We were just talking back and forth to each other sternly.",

    "body": "Am I the asshole for asking my dad to replace the fuel that he used?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nalright my dad has a bad temper. That's always been the case. He's known for beating up his siblings when they were kids. Now, my mom got pregnant and married him anyway because that's just how it is in our culture (this fucking drives me nuts everytime). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, my mom got a new little starlet so that I could use it to pick her up from work everyday. She's too afraid to drive, so I obliged. I loved that car. It was so efficient, and I only spent $40 a week on fuel (I never had to ask my mom to pay for fuel). This year, my dad decided to show off to the boyz at work and sold the starlet. He got a nissan bluebird instead. Bear in mind that he already had 2 cars on finance (a bmw x3 and a mazda premacy) before getting the bluebird, which is also still on finance, btw. They all have big engines (at least 2.0). My mum and he had a deal that he's not allowed to use the bluebird to work. He's a really bad driver and he's already ruined the premacy. He never uses the BMW, he only uses it when there's a family gathering to fcking show off to our family friends and well family. \n\nSo I've been using the bluebird for a while now, and now the fuel expenses on that car goes up to $80 so my mom also pays for the fuel. Heck, sometimes I even have to tell her 3 times that I need fuel money to pick her up. I pay my part of it, but I'm nothing but a poor uni student who depends on my part-time job pay. I only get $200 a week, but I have other expenses and I'm saving out to move out of this fucking shithole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, he did not go to work and while I was making breakfast for myself (I am a bit of a health freak and I'm doing my best to get my shit together), I saw him take off using the bluebird. I just filled up the tank yesterday, and knowing him, he won't replace the fuel he used because he's fucking selfish but I tried anyway. I texted him, \"dad, could u pls replace the fuel that you'll be using today? I'm saving up for something. thnks.\" \n\nHe snapped real quick and called me and told me how he pays for it every week and all that. Now I'm looking up bikes online (which I should have done ages ago, btw), so that I won't have to deal with their shit anymore. \n\nI feel like I'm the only mature person in this house, tbh. They are both extremely inefficient and they make bad decisions all the time. They were also extremely abusive when I was a kid, so there's that too. The funny thing is that they talk shit about each other to us, their kids. I just can't anymore, tbh.",

    "body": "I work in a small office (less than 25 people).  Upon hire, I was informed the president of the company would be the person I report to.  His wife (who is the office administrator and company HR representative - which is an absolute joke, btw) was to be notified of vacation and sick days, etc.  About 4 months into the job, without notification, the wife assumed role of my manager.  First of all, she is not very knowledgeable about my exact position, and my role.  Second, she has a strong personality and is always correct.  It is her way or the highway.  Third, she is the type of person who often \"comes in hot\" on a topic and will escalate situations quickly, will raise her voice and even say inappropriate things.  During one of our interactions, she was getting frustrated as I was suggesting more detail to a project, while she was striving for \"efficiency\" - again, not fully understanding the scope of my work.  So she says to me \"Just because you don't understand what I'm saying doesn't make you a bad person\".  I kid you not.  First of all, I understood what she was saying, but her suggestions were not appropriate for the project (I later had 4 other people from the office -3 of the 4 were senior members of the team- who had overheard this exchange come into my office and offer support stating that this is just the way she is).  Since that interaction there have been several others where I have been belittled and bullied by my new manager aka the boss's wife.\n\nMy husband says it is affecting my life outside of work as I am often upset after work and my mood is often low because of the abuse I get on a daily basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to \"screw\" over my co-workers.  But, this is an incredibly toxic environment for me and I need to get out quickly.\n\nShould I put in resignation or wait until bosses return, then put in resignation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:  I did it!

    "body": "My partner works shift work, about 35 hours a week and usually in the evening/weekends. He has two online classes he is taking at the same time. Most days he takes a nap, does some studying, the dishes or some laundry and then goes to work.  He wants to shorten this to 25 hrs. \n\nI work anywhere from 40-60 hours a week. It’s very much a “work goes with you” type job and is very stressful/fast paced. I also did an online course during this job, but am now finished.\n\nWe have two kids (6 and 10.) Both are active, which means extracurriculars 5 evenings a week, plus all the regular business of kids. Often I feel like between work, kids, cleaning, I have very little time to myself. \n\nMornings are hectic. With all of us getting ready, kids eating, making lunches, etc - it is a race against time. I often ask my partner to wake up and help me out. On the days where he worked later the night before (past 11) I don’t ask for him to wake up. I then have to make sure to wake up earlier (takes longer to do everything on my own) and leave the house earlier (to get the kids to daycare and then to work on time).\n\nDays when he wakes up it goes much smoother. I can sleep in slightly, and because he takes the kids straight to school I can leave a bit later. We still share the morning workload those days. \n\nNow, often he complains about this. He says that since he doesn’t work until later he shouldn’t have to get up. He also says that he just needs more sleep than me. This bothers me because not only am I constantly on the go and  exhausted, but I also have a disorder that causes me to have less energy (among other things). \n\nCatalyst was this afternoon. I was exhausted this morning, he woke up with me but was not happy. I thanked him for his help and went to work. At lunch I ran home to bring him food because I know he wasn’t feeling awesome and he was napping. When he woke up he started complaining again about how he should have slept in, and that he needs more sleep than me. \n\nI could not hide my frustration. I told him that I work long hours, have very little time to relax like he does, that I am constantly exhausted (he jokes that he can never watch a full movie with me because I can never stay awake) and the last time I slept while he got up was the day after Christmas last year. I told him that if he never wants to get up again, that’s fine, I will wake up earlier every day - but stop pretending it is because you are more worn out and start accepting it is because you just don’t want to help. \n\nSo - am I the asshole for wanting help in the mornings even though my partner doesn’t have to get up for work?",

I know she doesn't have reddit but our other friends do so I'm not risking it. \n\nI (18) gave my friend Eliza (18) a stick and poke tattoo about a month or two ago while we were hanging out, and she had me get a similar one in the same area as a best friends thing. The tattoo is slightly smaller than a nickel in size and it's on the inside of her ankle. \n\nTonight she just texted me saying that it was an emergency and she needs me to burn her tattoo off as her parents won't pay for college if she has one. She's extremely paranoid about student loans and refuses to take any out so this is a big deal to her. \n\nI told her under no conditions am I burning her to take the tattoo off. It will fade in a year, it's unlikely her parents will see it, and frankly it's ridiculous that she's asking me to intentionally burn her to take it off. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea of holding a lighter to her ankle just to get rid of it or burning anyone in general. I don't even know if the tattoo will disappear after the burn heals. \n\nShe's really upset with me for telling her that \"under no conditions am I burning you\". I told her she can ask her boyfriend or any other friends but it won't be me . She thinks I'm obligated to because I gave her the tattoo in the first place and her boyfriend will probably fuck up burning it off but I doubt I'm any more qualified to do that. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling her I won't burn her?\n\nedit: she also refuses to burn it off herself? she says concealer isn't an option since she might forget and it will be obvious when she wears flipflops at the beach.  she's a little bonkers but this might be the craziest thing she's ever asked me to do.  \n\nedit 2: apparently she's freaking out bc the tattoo means a lot to her since it was a friends thing but she doesn't want to risk college which understand. her new idea is to cut it off. idk how im friends w someone who thinks like this lmao.",

I told her that is ridiculous and nobody is 9 inches and she said \"okay he said he was 7 and 3/4\". Then she said she wouldnt tell me who had the giant dick. \n\nI told her I couldnt tell if she was joking or not anymore and I was uncomfortable with the joke, and I explained it was because of me being a virgin prior to her while shes had 4 partners so it was a soft spot for me. She told me I was getting pissy and it was obviously a joke, and she said I always get annoyed with her when she gets high and it ruins her fun. Then she went to bed so that was the end of the talk.\n\nI should add as a side note that Im pretty big down there (not 7 3/4 big) so I wasnt self conscious about myself - it was more just being uncomfortable about the subject as a whole.\n\nSo AITA for telling her I wasnt happy with the joke she made?\n\nEDIT we talked about it and cleared it up, she thought I would take it as a joke, and I was in a bad mood due to other stuff unrelated to her happening that night.

    "body": "I have worked for a chain restaurant as a delivery driver for a little over 9 years now. It has its up and downs but all in all I have been treated fairly, my manager has been a really understanding man.  The restaurant charges a fee for delivery, (X) but the drivers and chain have been splinting the fee between us (Y) , even when it raised the price so nothing to complain about. About 9 months ago it raised its delivery price by another 25 cents, the drivers didn't get an upgrade in pay but no one really cared, so it was now drivers (Y) and company (Y plus $.25). Then a few months ago they decided to up the delivery price another quarter so now drivers get (Y) and the company get (Y plus $.50) but again no one complained, nothing to rock the boat about I guess. But then a few days ago the GM decided to cut the drivers pay per delivery by $.50 without changing the delivery fee. So now it would that drivers get (Y)  and the company gets (Y plus $1.50) and now this change is upsetting every driver including myself. The GM is try to justify this change because the change in price was to coincide with price of gas as it was going up but now that is going down the drivers don't need that much money to pay for the gas plus that the drivers are paid the minimum wage  yet are \"Tipped\" employees.  Now here's the thing, I don't know about other places but the drivers here are lucky enough to get tipped so for us every dollar counts, especially since we have to pay for our own expenses on our vehicles so that pay cut will effect us. When I saw that notice it was upsetting, so I have to know if would be wrong to to leave my job because of the a downgrade in pay for delivery.",

    "title": "AITA Am I right to be upset at husband or crazy/insecure as he says?",
    "body": "I {29/f} am upset with the several things my husband [27/m] has been doing lately.\n\nThe most recent issue: He went to the lake with his friend. I didn't go because I'm 36 weeks pregnant, didn't want to be out in the hot sun for hours and using their tiny little restroom every 30 minutes. I told him I may or may not join later, would let him know.\n\nI decided to join hours later, I called when I got there.No answer. Some minutes later, I see his boat about to approach the dock. Before doing so, I saw him stopping next to a couple girls. They got in his boat, then another girl nearby (a friend of the 2 girls) was nearby and got in as well. He then took them for a boat ride for about 30-40 minutes. He never saw me waiting at the dock. He didn't know either because he didnt look at his phone to see my missed calls. So when he comes back, I'm pretty upset. I don't feel like he had business picking up 3 young girls in bikinis and giving them a ride. When he comes back, all of the girls give him a hug and thank him, one of them saying \"I hope your gf is not mad.\" The girls didnt know I was there waiting for him. He saw me there and corrected her saying \"wife.\" When they left, I asked him why they were on the boat. He said he just picked them up to help them get to the dock so they didnt have to walk a long distance. I asked how long, he said 10 minutes. So he lied straight up. I saw him pick them up, then go for a boat ride, that lasted 30-40 minutes while I roasted under the sun.\n\nThat is just one thing he did recently. I told him he is not single and that a married man had no business doing that. He says he did nothing wrong. He called me crazy and insecure. I have been in tears for days. Can barely eat or sleep well.\n\nAm I right to be upset? Do I need counseling?\n\nEdit: I'll just add a couple other things he has done to upset me. His ex gf called from her personal phone to let him know his deposit refund check is there in the office of his old apt, she works there (btw, it was supposed to have been mailed like the letter stated). He deleted that call from his log, went there to collect the check, and was MIA for 2-3 hours, lost his phone, and was late in picking me up. he lost his phone somewhere around that old apartment, then the car wouldn't start, he called tow truck services to jump start the vehicle when his brother lives down the street. He was not going to tell me he went there, I only found out by putting things together like his phone being lost and he's looking for it by the old apartment that his ex works at? And that he was late in picking me up bc car wouldn't start and didn't have a means to call me?\n\nAnother thing: He recently downloaded snapchat again. He was browsing through the contacts, deleting some people. This after he told me months ago that he deleted snapchat. Then I discovered that he had contacts on there and were subscribed to people he said he had blocked (these were women who sent him inappropriate videos while I was with him). These people were not just plain friends, they were exes, and women whose only purpose on snapchat is to show their bodies off.\n\nOne other thing: he's abusive. He has pushed me, twisted my hands so hard and sprained my finger that I fell to the ground out of the pain, and slapped me on several occasions. All while having a big pregnant belly. He says that if I disrespect him i deserve to have the shit beat out of me. We have different values. We're both Muslims but he is going on a different path. For instance I do not want to watch nudity or half-nudity scenes in our house. That is something he has hit me over because I tell him to stop watching it.\n\nI am begging him to seek counsel since he thinks I am in the wrong. He says I am crazy & insecure and that he does nothing wrong. He refuses to seek counsel and says \" I dont give a f*** about what other people think is right or wrong, I know what I did was not wrong.\"\n\nSorry this is all over the place. I am an emotional mess right now.",

When we were teens she was pretty mean to me about being fat, ill admit back then I was pretty fat but after HS I wanted to lose weight and get in shape and my sister was my biggest supporter.  But recently she's really into that \"body positivity\" and I think her BF is into that too.\n\nI really thought he knew about her teasing me cause of my weight as a kid.  I hold no grudge over what she said to me as a teen cause I know she regrets it now and were good.  But when she said that I kinda smirked and jokingly said something like \"why couldn't you be so body positive when I was fat? you hated me as kids cause of that.\"  I started laughing hoping that she would join in but I got nothing but a glare from her and her BF looking pretty shocked at what he heard.  He then got up and left the scene my sister called me a dumbass and went with him.  I didn't think anything of it, I heard some screaming and arguing coming from their room but I had the couch with my GF so I just blocked that out.\n\nThe next day they are SUPER tense around each other and I feel kinda bad, my sister is kinda pissed at me and said I should've just kept my mouth shut, while her BF is saying I did the right thing saying that.\n\nI do feel bad that I caused the fight but I think both of them are being very over dramatic over this.\n\nAITA for telling a joke that caused a big fight between my sister and her BF?",

    "body": "I'm on a sports team (at a D1 NCAA school) and have a close friend, let's call her Louise, who is always my weight training partner. She's my best friend on the team of 17 people.\n\nWe have weight training three days a week and Louise and I always share a bench, which is usually ok. The thing is that Louise is very very slow. When you share a bench, you also share equipment, so if Louise is still working through one exercise, I can't start my next set until she's done. This was fine when we didn't have timed workouts. I would wait for her to finish and then I'd do my sets. I might have to stay 5 minutes late, but it was worth it to be with my friend.\n\nThe thing is that we've just started doing timed workouts, where you have 20 minutes to complete as many circuits as you can and you are expected to either lift heavier or finish faster every time you lift. The problem is that Louise slows me down, so I'm in danger of not hitting my numbers while she's slowly finishing up with the equipment I need. She could be faster, but she insists on matching the weights I'm doing, so if I do an exercise with 20 lb weights, she isn't really ok with using the 15 lb weights. Our weight training partners are still kind of flexible but honestly, there isn't really anyone as slow as Louise. I don't know who she'd go with if I weren't her partner and we're friends so I don't want to leave her but at the same time, I don't want to get in trouble for being so slow.\n\nWIBTA if I asked another teammate to do these timed circuits with me.",

We got together when I was 16, he was 18 and were together roughly 5 years before being married for nearly 4.\nWithout going into the gory details, he was not the greatest husband, I suffered many forms of abuse throughout that relationship but eventually found the courage to leave him.\nWe aren't involved in each other's lives anymore, but are still on speaking terms, but only when entirely necessary. We still live in the same (reasonably) small town and are both seeing other people.  \nI pretty much tell no one the things he did to me in that relationship, only my 2 closest friends who helped me through the break up, my sister, and my boyfriend. I originally kept quiet out of respect for him because I was still in that abused 'he's not that bad' kind of mindset. Now I keep quiet just to be the bigger person. He (being the manipulative sociopathic person that he is) has spun a whole web of lies about me to all the people who knew us as a couple, leaving out every terrible thing he ever did and placing all blame on me. That's fine, it doesn't bother me any more, but I'm just trying to paint a picture of why I don't want any attachment to him.  \n\nAnyway...  \nHe bought and paid for the engagement ring which was worth about $2500 (he got it half price I believe) and I bought and paid for my wedding ring* which was about $1200. I want to sell them a) because the money would be good, even though I'm sure they're not worth much now, and b) because I want to be rid of them and what they symbolise.  \nMy boyfriend and sister think I should sell/pawn them, but my friends don't think I should. \nThey think it would just make me look bad and if people found out it would just kind of make me look like the awful person he has told people I am... I'm also scared that one day he will ask for the engagement ring back and I won't know what to tell him.  \nTo be clear: he has never mentioned them and never asked for them back. However if I sell them I do not plan on asking/ telling him, mainly because I'm afraid of him and don't know how he would react + It's just another story to tell about me.  \n*I have no real issue selling the wedding ring as I paid for it myself .  \n\n\nSo WIBTA if I sold the rings without telling him?",

The sun was starting to go down a tiny bit, but it wasn't even reaching the point that I would call twilight. Good visibility, still quite sunny/bright. No clouds. I was driving behind a man in a white van who kept slamming on his brakes. I didn't know what that was all about, so just maintained a safe distance between us and kept on.\n\nAll of a sudden, he stopped in the middle of the street (not even at an intersection), put his van in park and jumped out of his car and started screaming towards me. He wasn't moving towards me and I was more confused than anything so I just sat there for a minute until he started gesturing at me and yelling louder. I rolled my window down a crack to see what he was yelling about, and he was screaming some variation of \"Turn your fucking headlights on!/Why aren't your lights on\" peppered with lots of profanity.\n\nAt this point, I was kind of pissed that he was blocking my way and yelling at me for something that wasn't even illegal. So I turned my headlights on and then flashed my brights at him. He kept yelling so I flashed them a few more times and he got in his van and sped off. I told the story to my friend and they told me I was an asshole for flashing my brights at him, but I was trying to express to him that a) I heard him and b) he was being a jerk without actually confronting him. AITA?  \nAlso, I looked it up online later and civil twilight was at 8:10pm that day.",

    "body": "[Ok so the first thing I want to say is this is my first post and it’s on mobile so if things jump around I apologize. I also don’t want to make this into a wall of text but this is an emotionally complicated thing for me so it’s hard to explain shortly but I’ll do my best.]\n\nI’ll start with, well the start. I would have been around 10(m) at this point in time and I’m now 16 almost 17. Around 2012 my mom and dad got divorced. I have no clue when this happened and I barely remember the year because I have tried (wether consciously or subconsciously) to suppress as much as I can about everything that’s happened. My mom was the one who left unlike what seems to be most peoples stories of the other way around. I can’t even explain how hurt and destroyed I was then so I’m not going to try and explain it now. All you need to know is that it was really f-ing bad for me and my dad emotionally. We felt completely betrayed. I lived about as comfortable as a life as I could have after all that happened.\n\n So fast forward to the past 2-3 years and I live primarily with my dad and visit my mom on weekends. (Also I’m gonna clear this up now, I love my mom to death even after everything that happened and I can’t thank her enough for everything she’s done for me).  My mom and now stepdad weren’t actually married until about 2-3 years ago so my title might not be 100% accurate but he was around from the start they just weren’t married. This is where the AITA shit begins. I treat my stepdad like he is basically nobody. Just some random dude with no relation to me and I’m starting to feel like an ass cause of it. This dude has done so much for me. He makes my mom happy, he’s pretty much the only reason we can get super nice stuff because my mom is a librarian, he gives me presents on my bday and Christmas, and he’s the reason we’re about to move into a much nicer house than what we currently live in.  And yet after all of this I still can’t bring my self to be thankful, or at to least show him I’m thankful. \n\nAm I the asshole for ignoring and treating my stepdad like he’s unrelated to me for so long?\n\n{If you need more info or context I’ll try my best to answer and give you the info you need. I will also be accepting whatever judgment you guys pass and depending on what is judged I’ll try to be better towards him and show more appreciation. I also will gladly take any advice given.}\n\nEdit 1: Ok I’m gonna bring this up now because I feel like it’s necessary at this point. I haven’t been told why the divorce happened and have been told if I still want to know when I’m 18 my dad will tell me. But now my grandma has already told me. We were talking a few months ago and I asked her if my mom cheated on my dad and she didn’t say yes directly but she basically confirmed it. If she didn’t cheat it wasn’t anything better, that’s all I know. I should also mention this was my dads 2nd divorce (basically 3rd but he wasn’t married to the first)  and that also weighs on my mind and how I feel about everything.\n\nEdit 2: wow I sure am editing a lot for a 30 min old post. So I also feel like I should bring up that while my stepdad does buy me things. If anything it feels like he’s just buying me over until I stop visiting, outside of that the ignoring is mutual. Neither of us actively try to talk to each other or engage with one another. He’s never once said he loves me and I’ve never said it to him. The only time we ever communicate is asking each other questions like where my mom is or what we want for dinner. We’ve gone months without saying a word to each other.",

    "body": "It's about my friend, he's a brother of my ex gf, we've known each other for 4+ years. \n\nOne day I called him and we meet for drinks, he introduced me to some of his new friends, and we all have great time together and I invited them to my place for a cookout, and that repeats a couple of times, we go out, have drinks, they come over, I cook for them and we chill, everything's great.\n\nI noticed him being fairly close to this one girl in the group but didn't think much of it. Later out of curiosity I asked him if he felt anything for her, and he basically said that he likes her as a friend and that she's a cool person to hang out with, later I asked her the same question and she gave me the same answer, they're just friends. So I started chatting with her and slowly, we started spending more and more time together and then we started dating in secret at first, we didn't want to tell anyone until we were sure it's not just a fling, after a month or so, we decided to tell all our friends but in a nice way, we wanted to suprise them becouse it's all good news. So I invited them all for a dinner.\n\nShe goes first and tells them that she's staying in the country, and it's cheers and hugs all around, then I told them we're together and at first there's shocked silence then again yelling and cheering but I noticed him being unusualy quiet. That evening he stayed short, excused himself and left early. Tomorrow I sent him a message to see if everything is alright, but he didn't answer for the first time in 4 years. Then a week or so later my gf came home and said that he confronted her in the mall and told her that she rushed into this, that she needs to beware of who I am, and that she's making a mistake. She didn't know what to say and frankly neither did I when she told me about it but now we knew we had a problem on our hands. He just tried to sabotage my relationship behind my back!\n\nSo another month passes, I gave him time to answer my messages, he didn't, and she tells me again that he confronted her about us, he told her that WHEN our relationship is done, we are no longer friends, and basically that I am this big bad guy and she's making a mistake. Now I couldn't tolerate this any longer and I gave him a call and asked him what's up trying really hard to stay polite, he then told me that this was completely unacceptable of me, dating his best friend, and that it's her fault too choosing me over their friendship that it's like I'm dating his sister again, and that we are no longer friends. I tried to talk some sense into him but in vain. \n\nNow basically I lost a friend, she lost a friend, the whole group of friends is sided one way or the other and no one is talking about it, I have no idea what went down, my only working theory is that he was secretly in love with her and didn't want me to know, we are still together and doing great but the whole situation is kinda sad for us every time we remember him.

One of them Taylor (not real name) 22f works full time office job is in charge of the bills and rent. Now we’ve talked before about her having that responsibility, and I’ve offered before to put some of the bills in my name. (we did end up transferring one account to me, so to get a student concession, starting next month). Each month she messages the group chat sometimes with a screenshot of the portion of the bill with the amount due, and sometimes she just states the total amount, and we transfer to the rent account ( a bank account in her name, that i dont have access to) for her to pay. \n\nI always transfer usually within around 3 days of her messaging, very often on the same day. I'm not 100% sure on this but typically you have around 2-3 weeks after receiving the bill to settle the account. This month (I cant find the original message about how much and when electricity was due) according to my bank statement, I transferred my portion around 3 weeks ago. The bill was due last wednesday. This morning, (monday) i get a message from her saying something along the lines of “im so sorry, i didn’t get paid in time to pay the electricity bill so its now $125 more. Can you each transfer me another $43, sorry”\n\nObviously generally I have no intention of skipping out without paying my share, except that I did pay my share. This isn’t even the first time this has happened. Early on in our living together, she without consulting us, applied for an extension to the internet bill and we each had to pay a bit more. It wasn’t much that time maybe $7, but i was annoyed because had she asked me, i would have lent the money to pay on time. This time, its considerably more money, and again, had she talked to me last week I could have helped her out. I’d much prefer to lend and cover the difference then be told that i have to pay a late fee. \n\nTLDR, I paid on time, she didn't, and now she wants me to contribute to the late fee.

The situation is that I don't check my phone very often, and this is the first direct communication I have gotten from my aunt. I did not see the messages until today. I considered her 'follow up' message extremely childish and wanted to avoid having those sorts of interactions going forward as they are very common in my family. This is mostly here for clarity/posterity, judgement seeeeemssss basically done. (IATAH)\n\nMy objective in my (rude) 3-sentence message was to make it clear that I considered her message unacceptable, That I understand that she is upset but it is not a good reason to send messages like that, and to avoid having those sorts of interactions in the future. The negative-caps lock-angry messages is something that is common in my family and which I hoped to 'put my foot down' and avoid in my adulthood.\n\nI interpreted her response as a 'dodge' and deflect. She has a history/reputation of being extremely petty/passive aggressive (something I didn't want to share initially for bias reasons). Asking someone to \"see a professional\" is a very common and fairly serious insult in my family, as there is a major stigma against mental health issues.\n\nA few commentators don't believe me that I don't check my phone often, which is odd. I have attempted to be a 'reliable narrator', as much so as possible. I do believe everything I am sharing to be true. If I was interested in making myself look good to internet strangers, it wouldn't be hard to make actual changes to the narrative to do so, or share more 'context' then what is necessary to understand the situation. \n\nThank you all for your replies, I appreciate them.\n\n--End of edit---\n\n----GROUP CHAT: Me, 2 Brothers, Dad, Mom, Aunt----\n\nMarch 25:\n\nAunt: Happy Palm Sunday Fam!

I get your upset but your twice my age and should be able to control yourself. In the future please act like an adult when messaging me.\n\nAunt: Skelly are you commicating with me, you aunt Auntiepants? If so... this message was sent [two weeks ago]. Don't you think it's a bit irrelevant at the moment! If this is your reply, it's a clear indication of how off you are. In fact, you worry me so much that it leads me to think you need to adress it with a proffessional. \nLove you! \nPS I'm glad you came for Easter!\n\n----END----\n\nI can give more context if asked. I get that my message might have been a bit much but I can talk more about that if its 'on the fence'. Idk.

    "title": "AITA for telling my sister to pay me back for a graduation trip I took her on?",
    "body": "My(24F) sister(18F) and I have always had trouble getting along. When she was 12 she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'll admit I used to be someone who didn't really believe in mental illness, but over the years due to my sister and friends I've tried to become more accommodating to those types of things and our relationship had improved greatly due to that. I'm still not the best at understanding it, but I try.\n\nMy sister \"graduated\" from school in June. She had struggled with school due to her illnesses. She school a lot and failed several classes prior to her senior year, but by the grace of her counselor and her own determination, she managed to walk.\n\nWhen she graduated I told her as a present for her hard work I'd take her anywhere she wanted. She chose Taiwan since she studied Chinese in school and because I lived there for 1.5 years during college and said it was a great place to visit.\n\nBefore booking the trip I asked to see her diploma, but she and my mom told me it was delayed due to a grade being put in late and wouldn't arrive for a few weeks. Since my mom was backing her up I said okay and we booked for early August.\n\nThe trip goes on and we have a great time. I accommodated her anxiety by going to tourist spots during dead hours, eat at off hours, stay in when needed, etc. At the end of the trip my sister told me it was the most genuine fun she's had in a long time.\n\nLife goes on, September is nearly over when my youngest sister(16F) calls me up. We talk for a while, she finally complains about our sister sleeping late. I get confused because she shouldn't be sleeping late due to attending college?\n\nYounger sister tells me that our sister didn't actually graduate and she thought I had known. She was supposed to finish an online class to get her diploma but never did. I immediately call up my mom and dad who confirm it. I then told my mother that I would like sister to pay me back for her ticket as that was supposed to be a graduation present. My mother gets upset and tells me I need to respect sister's mental health and she can't do that right now. We argue and my mother hangs up.\n\nI decide to go home the next day and confront sister about her diploma. I try to talk about it but she starts crying the second I mention her diploma. To be short I ended up telling her that she can either find a way to get her diploma within the year, or she has to pay me back for her plane ticket at least. My sister cries that she can't do that - she needs a mental break and can't handle getting her diploma right now, can't say when she will get it, and can't pay me back.\n\nIt's been several days but sister and parents all say I'm a complete asshole for wanting my money back. Younger sister is on my side, but she is very similar to me. My friends are also very divided. Quite a few say I'm an asshole and shouldn't risk my sister's mental health over $1000, while others think my sister needs to face reality, which I agree with.",

An aunt to one of my sons friends has asked me to do a large extended family session (30 people) for them. They have chosen a time/location that just isn’t really ideal. Theres only so much flash/reflecting that can be done with a group this size and its honestly going to be more work than the session costs.   \n\n I suggested two things, 1. Change the time to later in the day when the sun wasn’t so harsh and unflattering or 2. Drive a little further down the same road and utilize an area with a nice tree bed to allow an even continuous lighting. Both options were a no for the client. \n\nAm I an asshole if I chose to not shoot the session? They haven’t booked yet. Theres still a few weeks for them to check out some recommendations I have to offer (although, none of them have jumped for joy at the opportunity themselves either). I just don’t have the time to deal with the hassle that comes from doing this session mid-day w/ no shade.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: I read through the comments and took some advice. I let her know that I wouldn’t be able to to do it and she was actually pretty ok about it. She said she understood and would take any recommendations I had. \n\nI’m not sure why I was so worried.

    "body": "Sorry for any poor grammar or any rule breaking this is my first post. Alright lets get into it! So when I was 11-13 my parents were heavy alcoholics and my Dad was homeless. My Mom and my stepdad would get physically and mentally abusive (I could elaborate but I don't feel comfortable doing so on the internet). It ended for the most part after the second time I called the police and my stepdad got arrested. Afterward my mom drank heavy and shamed me for about a week. The new problem arose when my stepdad got released. He was on house arrest and wasn't allowed to have contact with us for a month. My mom decided it would be a great idea to take us to visit him two days after he was placed on house arrest (he was only in jail for 10 days).I was uncomfortable with the interaction and tried to walk home but I felt like my mom forced me to stay. My stepdad was perky and uncomfortably happy. His initial response to me calling was positive but slowly after he started poking fun and shaming me. I brought up how fast we were interacting to our social worker and the interaction went something like this:\n( social worker was asking about our relationship )\nMe: I don't know. I feel like he came home to early.\nStepdad: What do you want me to do zilla? Do you want me to move away?\nIdk but for some reason that and the events mentioned before eat at me a little. Now I'm 17 and all the social workers and what not are gone. I am severely depressed and frustrated as I cannot drive and I cannot work by my moms choosing. My stepdad and I are always back and forth over stupid things such as me messing up while making coffee ( filter broke and grounds got into the pot ). I try to explain to my mom why I am sad and she essentially says \"Oh I understand my mom did etc.\". I don't know if it's her trying to relate to me but I'm trying to discuss current issues that are plaguing my life. Then I try to explain to my stepdad why I don't trust him and my problems with his tone and comments. He gets angry and then I bring up his previous actions that I remember. He gets uncomfortable and says he doesn't remember doing those things and asks me to quit talking about them as they hurt his feelings. I just want him to understand three things\n1. Why I don't trust him\n2. Why I cannot just let it go\n3. Why I don't like his tone and the manner he presents himself with (It's very similar to when he was drinking)\nThen this is what I would like my mom to understand.\n1. Why I am sad\n2. Why I feel disappointed in myself\n3. Why I want to move out\nPlease respond any feedback is welcome If this goes well I'll post another concerning my dogs.",

    "body": "So I have been with my current company for about five years, but recently moved to a much larger department back in February. This department is really big on food days, celebrating birthdays, holidays, and on occasion ordering in food. \n\nI have Crohns, and usually cannot eat any of the food brought in or ordered because I have extreme sensitivities and just never know what will set me off. I’d rather not partake than risk an issue. My boss and most of my coworkers are aware that I have issues, and I have insisted plenty of times that they shouldn’t feel bad or attempt to cater to my issues. My supervisor feels bad sometimes, but I’ve insisted that I’m ok with it (and I do mean it, I’m not upset about being excluded).  \n\nSo the AITA part: everyone in our department makes a big deal about saying a big thank you, sending an email and CCing the entire department, etc. I don’t usually reply because it doesn’t apply to me - they know I can’t have it, and I don’t see a reason to say thank you for food I won’t be eating. In fact, I think it could come across as sarcastic or rude to say “thanks for buying the pizza I can’t eat” but a coworker thinks I’m being rude for not acknowledging the gesture. \n\nAITA?",

For about a month now I've noticed a young boy, about 12-14, who brings his dog to the dogpark occasionally at night. Occasionally as in, I've seen him about 6 times this month. Every single time he is out here with his dog he abuses them. He shoves, he pushes, and he verbally assaults his dog. He will kick the fence and scream/yell for him to come. Ignoring the fact that he never even goes into the dog park to pick up after his dog as well, he is just an absolute nightmare to listen to. I hear and see him yelling, and dragging, and yanking his dog every freaking time. All the while he is on his phone screeching to whoever the fuck is his friend. I got so fed up, that today after he yanked his dog out of the park, with a loud yelp from the dog with his tail between his legs mind you, that I walked to the front of the building and watched which other apartment (out of 8) that he walked into. I have no idea how to go about reporting him to anyone, even if I speak to management he is a minor and I don't know who he even is, all I know is the building he is in which has 8 different families/apartments in it. \n\nWIBTA if I continued to try and figure out who his parents are? Maybe when they take said dog to the dogpark? And try and speak to them about this abhorrent behavior? What if I get the wrong people and look like a lunatic ya know. Im just so sick of hearing and witnessing such horrible abuse. I would like to hope that this dog gets treated better at home, but maybe its learned behavior on the boys part. It may seem like a validation post or something but I'm honestly worried for this dog and don't know what to do and don't want to seem like THAT neighbor.",

    "body": "A friend (36f), I’ll call her Cate, started seeing someone we both used to work with, let’s call him Joe (42m) She always thought he was hot and was attracted to him when we all worked together, but she was married at the time and he was dating a string of different girls. Nothing came of it. Joe and I became good friends, and I became privy to a lot of personal details about him. He’s a vet with PTSD, an alcohol abuse problem and the tendency to cheat on every girl he’s ever dated. He and I no longer have any contact for a number of reasons, all to do with his shitty behavior. \n\nCate’s marriage fell apart (her husband was cheating on her it turns out) and she quickly started dating another guy that she ended up engaged to for a bit. I have told Cate about Joe’s instability and infidelity before as he has come up in conversation a few times, especially when he and I were still on good terms. I didn’t share the more personal details as those are his stories to tell, simply shared that he can’t keep it in his pants and he’s not as great to date as she fantasizes he would be. Life happens and Cate and I rarely see each other now as we no longer work together. \n\nLast time we went for lunch she told me she had finally broken it off with her boyfriend (he was basically leaching off of her, living in her house and treating her 3 teen kids poorly). She was glad to be single and planned to take some time for herself. \n\nFast forward to this summer. I was at another friends place who still has contact with Joe, and he told us that Cate reached out to Joe with a lingerie clad photo and an invitation to casual sex. Joe had showed the photo around. Obviously he dove in dick first. Shortly after that he was telling the same mutual friend that Cate is crazy, he needs to call it off but doesn’t know how to get rid of her. \n\nA couple of weeks later, Cate is posting photos of her middle son out on a day of hunting and fishing with Joe (they pulled him out of school for the day for this outing). Thing obviously progressed beyond casual sex at this point. \n\nI Have not talked to Cate about this relationship in person yet, but got a text from her saying that she should have listened to me, and from what I gather things have gone south with Joe. \n\nMy husband says to stay out of it, but WIBTA if I told her the truth: 1. That Joe was showing the photo to other people 2. That he was saying unflattering things to others and wanted to end things long ago and 3. Warning her that sending her kid out hunting with him is extremely dangerous (my hubby hunted with him last year - he got drunk, forgot to use the safety on his gun and left it loaded) 4. That he’s been through rehab twice before and should go again if he’s still drinking like a fish and 5. Remind her of history of cheating, lying and narcissistic behavior with every other girl he’s been with?\n\nI want to protect my friend, but Joe also thrives off of drama and I don’t want to get embroiled in his shit. \n\nWhat say you Reddit?",

She seemed to be ok after about a week. She started dating guys constantly for short periods of time (average relationship time: 2 months). She gets very emotional after each breakup, but is usually fine after a week, then goes and finds someone new. She shows signs of being bipolar and depressed, but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nAbout their relationship:\nShe was extremely clingy and got very attached in the first week.

When they were alone, she would start crying if he asked her to go home a bit early for whatever reason. He was not happy in this relationship, but she seemed very happy. When they broke up, she started bawling and rushed home. The next day we saw cuts on her arm.\n\nNow:\nWhenever we go out as a group she insists on coming with us, especially if my best friend is there. During most of the day she seems perfectly fine and happy. However, when it starts to get late, things change. She always wants me to comfort her and try to make her feel better since I've known her for a long time. My best friend just stands there and doesn't know what to do, and I feel bad for him. All she tells me is \"I miss him\" and \"I still love him\". My best friend has made it clear that he is not still interested in her.\n\nShe adds stress to the group whenever he's around, and there's nothing we can do to help. This has been going on for 5 weeks since the breakup, and I can't deal with it anymore. Me and my best friend agreed that we should break ties with her, even though it seems immoral (Just to clarify; she would still be hanging out with the rest of the group, but me and my best friend wouldn't be there when she is)\n\nWIBTA if I break ties with her?\n\nTL;DR\nMy best friend broke up with a girl I had known for a long time. He found her too clingy and wanted to break it off soon to avoid making things worse for both of them. She was severely impacted by this and constantly mentions how she still has feelings for him, even though my best friend told her he isn't interested anymore. She still hangs out with our group of friends but she always brings the mood down and starts crying. This has been going on for a few weeks now, and I can't take the stress of trying to cheer her up anymore.",

    "body": "Okay, the reason I’m posting this is because I have mixed results from my coworkers and friends. I’m on mobile, so sorry for any issues. TLDR @ bottom\n\nSome backstory; I’m a 16 y/o shift manager at a fast food chain. Over the summer I was working 50-60 hours a week, and when school started I said I can only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. This was obviously a blow to the management team, which consists of two full time managers (GM and AGM) and then another part time student who only works Sunday . \n\nHere is where the controversy comes in. I want to quit very badly. The reason is that I asked off 2 weeks ago for this coming Friday because I have finals this week (my school runs trimesters, weird right?) and I want to work on papers that are due at midnight. So my manager, when doing the schedule last thursday, got mad at me and told a coworker that she’s going to schedule me for Wednesday because i shouldn’t have asked off for a day that I usually work. \n\nWell, I’m screwed now because I have finals and a presentation due on Thursday and I will be working to ~11 Wednesday night, when I specifically said at the beginning of the school year I couldn’t work schooldays. My coworkers are saying I’d be an douche because I would leave the management stranded with no closer for Friday thru Sunday, especially seeing that we are starting to get busy now that the weather is picking up. \n\nTLDR: GM got mad at me because I asked off for a day I usually work because I have finals, so she schedules me a close in the middle of finals week.  Our management team would be fucked if I left, but I want to quit. \n\nSo WIABTA\n",

    "body": "So a little back story. Me and my girlfriend were together for exactly 1 year. She broke up with me the day after and said she wanted a week break. That ended up with me walking in on her a week later with another guy at her place the night after she said she still loved me and wanted to be together so I went around the next morning. We have been separated for nearly 3 months now. Anyway, I heard rumours of her cheating and she cried and denied it and got angry and wanted to find out who said it so I believed she didn’t do it. 2 days ago I received not 1, not 2 but 3 different screenshots of people she cheated on me with (not pics of the actual deed but messages) I was so upset because it was my first relationship and I feel like it meant nothing. I was also extremely angry so I took the screenshots, posted them on my social media and have been getting messages from more people telling me they knew she did this but didn’t want to get involved. I’ve had a few people tell me I’m an asshole because I should just let it go but the thing is she’s telling people I was toxic/manipulative when all I did was pay for her things, get her a job, ditch my friends for her. So in spite I posted it. AITA. \n\nAnd before you say I am wrong my best friend told me he’s seen a video with her and this other guy while we were together but didn’t want to tell me because he said I was so happy and always told him how much I loved her and wanted to be with her forever",

We regularly go shopping together, sometimes to plant nurseries to pick up flowers for our houses.

I'm not sure if I'm reacting appropriately, on one hand I am asking him to do something for free that's his job, and it's not out of line to ask someone to pay you for something you do professionally, family or not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, because of our background, I think me wanting a favour from him is appropriate. Every computer or smartphone he's had I've set up for him, and I've gone over to his house to take care of viruses on his computer easily 3-4 times. I've never charged him for it or held it over his head and behaved like now he owes me something. I regularly make a lot of the food he serves at parties (not potlucks), have spent time promoting his business with him, I've cleaned his house and taken care of his dog when he's been too sick to. He very rarely does favours for me, which I've never been upset by, he's busy and before this hasn't really been in a position to help me out with anything.

We had the Nintendo switch out playing smash, and every time he lost he would throw the controller down to the carpet.\n\nNo one else was doing that, and he kept just throwing it to the ground like if it was his stuff. We didn’t get too and because the ground was carpet, but we were annoyed nonetheless. \n\nThen later in the night, he kept opening his beers on my WOODEN furniture. He def dented my table and some other things. I was not ok with this. I mean, the table wasn’t really mine, it was a house mates, and the same for the other furniture, so I called him out. \n\nDespite that, he kept doing it, so inicie decided to take the beers away from the party and just leave the canned ones to avoid confrontation. \n\nLater, he was talking about how some beers he brought sucked, and then I jokingly replied, “yeah they suck” and he got extremely defensive about it. He kept saying “fuck you” and “what did you say bro,” and then he squared up to my face.  I told him to gtfo of my house and he said he wouldn’t. \n\nThat’s when I got mad and I decided to hold his fists because I did not want to fight.  I then told him to gtfo, and I then pushed  him all the way through the hall way through out the door because he kept pushing me and trying to free his hands like he was going to punch me. \n\nWhen I got to the door, he pushed against the wall and tried pushing me down, but I remember all the wrestling from hs loll and just flipped him to the floor. \n\nNow I know there are no rules in fight, but while I had him in the floor, he kept trying to bite me. I just grabbed his head and pushed it to the floor to keep him from actually biting me. \n\n\nI then lifted him and literally threw him out the door. His friend left shortly after. He was  “sorry”. \n\n\nI live with a bunch of other people, so I didn’t want to fight in our house.

Did I do wrong? AITA? Are the Roomate’s the assholes? The guy?\n\nJust venting. Sorry. Don’t know who is the asshole. ",

    "title": "WIBTA for blocking my ex after taking my car from her driveway",
    "body": "About 2 years ago, I took on a lease to get a car for an ex of mine. Loan is in my name so it's my property. We split up about 3 months after this happened and the breakup was messy, I basically kicked her out of the apartment after giving a couple of weeks to pack her belongings. She had a kid, no job, and had to find a place to live, so I figured I would at least let her keep the car until she got back on her feet.\n\nAfter a few months she got a job and started paying me back for the monthly payments on the lease. This worked pretty well for about a year. About 3-4 months ago she stopped paying me and said she was struggling financially. I figured it wouldnt take long for her to get back on track, but I've sent her multiple messages to seek payments and she has been either saying she needs more time or doesnt respond. Given knowledge of her behavior and personality, I'm positive she has no intentions of paying for the car and is hoping I'm too lazy and nonconfrontational to do anything about it.\n\nI've decided I'm ready to get my car back so I can sell it and use some of my money to pay off the lease. She has the only copy of the keys, so I will go to the dealership I purchased the car at and have another copy of the keys made. After this I will probably show up in the middle of the night to her neighborhood and use the keys to unlock the car and drive out of her driveway. I would leave any bulky items in front the house and drive off.\n\nAt this point I'm ready to cut the ex out so I can move on with my life. Obviously losing the car would be a big deal for the ex as it's her main mode of transportation and would affect if she needs to take her child anywhere or get to work. However she has made no effort to obtain a cheaper car and return mine so this is my only option. Since I had lent her the car willingly I dont think this would qualify as a stolen vehicle and police wont get involved in civil matters. Also the car is worth more than 10k, so this is beyond the scope of small claims court and I have no interest in the headache of taking this to civil court.\n\nOnce I have the car I was hoping to block my ex's number and other social media accounts. I would send her a brief message that I would return the rest of her belongings on my way to work the very next day or the day after, and then block her again. The only thing I can think of is if I dont say anything initially, she will obviously freak out and may think the car has been stolen (I doubt she would make the leap of logic that I had spare keys made or would tow the car myself), and I dont know how mean it would be to let her freak out about that.\n\nWIBTA for taking the car and then blocking her afterwards, only sending a message a couple of hours or maybe more later to say I took the car and will return belongings in the future?",

We were trying to settle an inheritance in which Mean Uncle (MU) stiffed us for a huge sum of money. This is important.\n\nI always loved my aunt, because she wasn't involved in the fighting, and her son and I have always been closerthanthis. This time though I noticed a painting hanging in the living-room. An old Jewish man in a black suit and payes holding a bag of money surrounded by more bags. I asked her what it was about, and she told me it was meant to bring money into the house. I told her that it was anti-Semitic and explained why. CR was also in the room but said nothing. \n\nI told CR how hurtful this was in private (my dad was a Holocaust survivor but he wasn't religious). CR told me I was overreacting and they couldn't bring up the matter as we were guests and said aunt had a nervous condition. But CR saw nothing wrong in bringing MU over knowing there would be fighting, because there always has been. My aunt had nothing to do with the inheritance. She and MU haven't even spoken as adults, and they live in the same city.\n\nI tried to raise the matter several times in a polite way, explaining why this was hurtful, but all I got out of it was my aunt showing me pictures of random people she knew, asking me to tell her if they were Jewish, and talking about her homeland the way overly zealous patriots will talk about the Fatherland, minus the tears. My mother was born there, so they kind of consider me a local in a way, and for the most part it really is a nationalistic cess pool. That painting was everywhere in that area, sold on markets, and in souvenir stores. I was so mad, I got into it with a woman selling them, and the outcome was CR siding with the woman and the woman saying, \"I have Jewish friends. They never said a word.\"\n\nI haven't spoken to my aunt since we left, and it's been quite a few years. Haven't told her son, because he idolizes his mother, and to be perfectly honest I'm scared of finding out he's the same. He's more open-minded, and less patriotic, but commented the rampant Anti-Semitic in his country with, \"I believe it was the Jews who killed Jesus, but I don't believe they should still be punished for it.\"\n\nSo, there you have it.

He has untapped sexuality issues and has tried multiple times to drunkenly make out with my SO, S. This has made S so uncomfortable that he refuses to go on the trip because of R and his drunken tendencies. \n\nR has also gotten mildly insufferable in the recent months, and has made me feel uncomfortable when we're alone, too. I resent that he's so out of control when drunk that he's turned my SO off to the trip (or being around him on general), and I don't really care for him to come with us. \n\nWIBTA if I refunded him his money (plane ticket and AirBnB) and told him not to come? And if I'm NTA, how the hell would I even approach that situation?",

    "body": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nRecently my parents said that they have plans to move to South Africa because of my Dads work (He works as a engineer for a company that builds mining tech) and that we would have to leave one on my cats behind since he is old and has a wound on his eye (He's in my post history if you want to see). Now the big problem I have with this is that when I was a mere 1 year old baby, my family moved to Australia and lived there for around 9 and a half years in which I changed schools 3 times because of my dads job then my parents decided to move back to Brazil leaving my two older brothers behind for Uni. This series of events let me a bit depressed since I hardly speak with my brothers in person and I had to leave a bunch of friends behind that lead to me Losing contact with them but after moving into a medium sized town called Mariana and staying there for 4 years(The town where I got two of my cats that includes the old one), my parents again decided to move to a big city nearby called Belo Horizonte in Which I am living in right now and it has been about 4 months since I moved here. This whole process has left me really depressed with the cultural shock and the major changing of things. I had my life planned out from doing until year 2 of highschool here and doing the rest in Australia to do uni there and join the army but the News of moving to a new continent and leaving everyone I know behind including one of my cats that I am unseparable from since he pratically comforts me and reduces my anxiety left me angry since Whenever I try to argue about it my parents Just laugh it off and say I'll change my mind when I go there. So WIBTA if I continue arguing against them or should think about my dads job situation?\n\nTL;DR: Parents want  to move to different country after not talking to me and deciding to leave my beloved cat behind when we actually move next year.",

    "body": "Throwaway\n\nMy wife and I are considered lower middle class and have three children 24,16 and 11. Three years ago, our oldest came out to us as transgender. We told her we would help in any way to ease her transition. She said she had everything covered since she already finished school, moved out of our home, working a decent job and had considerable savings. She had already spoken to her insurance company about coverage, seen a doctor about starting HRT and was seeing a therapist. I felt she had things in order, but my wife had the foresight to start putting money aside for my daughter, so we could help reduce any future costs.\n\nTwo years ago, my daughter moved to a more friendly LGBTQ+ city for better job opportunities and to have a more expanded community. Last year, she opened a second Instagram account and would post about expensive trips she was taking with her boyfriend and friends. My wife and I grew suspicious and asked about how she was paying for the trips. She explained she saved for the trips and her boyfriend was helping to pay. Since she is an adult, we didn’t dig deeper.\n\nA week ago, my daughter came home for my 50th birthday and told us that she was ready to start scheduling her surgeries. Insurance will cover bottom surgery. However certain ones like, breast augmentation and surgery to gain a feminine face and body are considered cosmetic and are not covered.\n\nWhen asked about how she attended to pay for these, she said that she wanted us to pay for everything.\n\nMy wife told her about the money that was set aside which amounts to about $4000. My daughter said she needed over $40 grand for the surgeries and possibly more to cover her living expenses, since she won’t be working while she recovers. We asked about the money she saved. She lied and said it wasn’t enough. When pushed more, she broke down and admitted that she had no more saving and that she was in debt. The city she moved to had a higher cost of living then she expected, plus the trips she took were financed by her savings, credit cards and payday loans.\n\nI told her we were not in a position to give her $40 grand, but the money that was saved could go towards her debt. She cried and reiterated she needed the full $40 grand or she would never be a real woman. My wife and I tried to come up with reasonable solutions, but my daughter kept insisting for the full amount. At some point, my wife told her that she was being selfish for not thinking about her siblings who still need our support. The two argued and my daughter eventually stormed out of the house.\n\nNow I’m at a crossroads, I am considering getting a second job to help my daughter and so she doesn’t do anything she’ll regret, but then again, I feel that she needs to learn my wife and I can’t fix everything. AITA\n\n **Edit: Thank you for the comments. I talked to my wife and showed her this post. We agreed that I won’t get a second job.** **We are going take some of the suggestions given and speak with our daughter about a solution**",

    "body": "This feels like such a strange situation, but I need some input from someone outside the house.\n\n\nI moved into a new shared house at the start of July, with 3 existing flatmates. I have a 2 year old, otherwise very well behaved, mixed breed dog. I mean, he's as close to perfect as possible. We train in agility, obedience, and dog sports, visit rest homes, and he's calm, quiet and has no other issues.\n\n\nMy other 2 flatmates have no issue with my dog. One is ambivalent, the other adores him. The flatmate in question, however, I'll call T. T has a background with dogs in this house - I've been told she had a border collie puppy whom she kept outside without shelter, which was taken away by the council for howling constantly. This all happened before I moved in. She is of the opinion that dogs should be outside, but she agreed when I moved in that my dog was an inside dog.\n\n\nNow, T's door doesn't fit in the frame. This hasn't been a major issue for her apparently, but it means that the door is not able to be fully closed. I also have recently discovered, T has a habit of leaving food on her floor. Generally, I watch my dog whenever he is free in the house, and he stays in my room when I'm out. I admit that there are times I've left my door open while studying and kept an ear out, but he's never been destructive or much of a nuisance so I thought all was well. I also assumed that by leaving the door open, my flatmate didn't have anything dangerous in her room. \n\n\nI got a message from T over the weekend that my dog had been going through the bin and the food in her room and had eaten the chocolate base of a pie she'd left on the floor. She said this had been an ongoing issue and that he'd been pushing his way in, and that I needed to stop him from going in. My thought process is that if she refuses to shut her door, she needs to accept that my dog can get in there and not leave dangerous food on the floor, at least until I can work with him on boundary training at her door. The situation has escalated and I've reached a bit of an impasse here with T, so Reddit, AITA?\n\n\nEdit: the message I received over the weekend was the first I've heard from her about this.",

Me and his close friends have tried everything we can think of... tried to get him to go to therapy and A.A, talked to him, tough love, sitting down with him and explaining how his behavior hurts us, trying to get him to do anything that would improve his situation. None of it has made a scratch and the problem has only persisted ( maybe even gotten worse ). Recently me and a friend talked to his parents and told them that he was in a bad place, leaving out the massive amount of alcohol he consumes. They spent the next couple of weeks paying more attention to him, calling him more often, and coming to see him ( we both moved away from our hometown ). He has always been good at playing things off so of course after their \"thorough investigation \" they both concluded that he was just in a rut and would come out of it. I would agree with them but i have lived with him over the last 5 years ( mostly because Im scared of what will happen when he is alone) and I know its not a rut. Its something he needs serious help with and if its not soon I'm afraid he will drink himself to death.

It was perfectly move-in ready but he wanted to do several construction projects that were invasive and messy. As a result, the space is quite a wreck and has been for a month.\n\n\n I just wrapped a week long contract job that was very emotionally and physically draining. During the time that I was on this contract job I was away from the house from early in the morning until very late into the evenings and even spent the night on location a time or two. I have been quite exhausted. I guess boyfriend has used this time to clean up the mess and get things done. Connected the washer and dryer, started painting ceilings.\n\nBoyfriend and I carved out a little bit of time to have tea and spend time together during this job. It was then that he expressed that he feels that I am running myself ragged and then running out of energy for our relationship. I expressed that I am very tired but can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I expressed that I needed to complete some things, get my bearings and then I'd have more time to focus on house things. The contract job ended today and I will be getting an extended break from my actual job in about 3 weeks.\n\nI thought that boyfriend understood my level of exhaustion until he asked me to please come home from the end of this contract job today and tape off the ceilings so that he/we could paint tonight. I initially expressed that I knew I would be tired and he said that I didn't need to tape off the ceilings. I felt guilty and unsupportive so I begrudgingly said I'd do it.\n\nHe texted me today as I am running around for this job and suggested that tonight we make dinner together (our stove is not even plugged in...our dishes are not unpacked, the cabinet doors aren't even on) drink wine and paint the ceilings. I was initially pretty pissed because we had JUST discussed how taxing things had been and that I was just a few weeks away from having more time. And I was annoyed that he couldn't wait a single day to start working on projects. And annoyed that this seemed more important than spending quality time together, though we would be spending time together while painting ceilings.\n\nI didn't say anything about it because I thought that I was maybe being overly emotional or difficult. But when he got home I was pretty upset and let him know that I thought he was being pretty unempathetic by piling work onto my plate the very evening I had wrapped this job.\n\nThis devolved into an argument when all I wanted was an evening off and for him to acknowledge that he had been kind of insensitive.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n",

She planned this without telling me, although I knew there was a chance she would go. I don't begrudge her going at all, because we desperately needed help when we were pregnant, and this was a time to help others. We only have one car, so she waited for me to come home from work Friday afternoon and left pretty soon after. She took our two eldest children with her (my stepchildren) and left our two toddlers with me - so she could take the eldest to see their grandparents who lived locally to my wife's half sister, all about 3 hours away.\n\n\nShe promised (pinky promised!) she'd be back in time on Sunday to share Father's Day with me, and so that all our children could be together for me. She even said she'd be back in time to prepare a father's Day meal for me. I was looking forward to this because for the last two years I've had to be away for work on father's Day.\n\n\nI had a pleasant enough weekend at home with our two youngest, but it's never the same when half your family is gone. I got plenty of message from my wife saying she missed us etc.\n\n\nMy wife returned home around 7pm Sunday evening and almost immediately walking from the car she said \"oh I'm too tired to cook you dinner\". When I said she could have given me warning that I needed to make other arrangements she said she'd been too busy to tell me. \n\n\nShe then got herself some snacks to eat, let the two eldest get their own food, and I ended up cooking and eating my own father's Day meal by myself. Any other day this would not really be an issue, but I felt sad and aggrieved that she would be so indifferent to my feelings on father's Day. However, when I tried asking her about it, she went on about how I never think about her feelings, and that I've missed other family occasions before (I'm in the military and away a lot).\n\n\nDoes it make me the asshole for reading too much into this? Should I just let it go? When I think about it, it doesn't seem a bit deal, but then it does.\n\n\nTwo other points: 1. She did get the kids to write a card and give me chocolates - I wasn't forgotten. 2. On mother's Day, I cooked her a meal which she refused to eat because she was angry about something the kids did, and then called it the worst mother's Day she'd had - so I know she values such days herself.",

I was in the last boarding group so I was amazed when I saw an open window seat near the front of the plane and nabbed it. There were two older women sitting in the middle seat and the aisle seat in the same row. When I asked them to let me in to the row they both gave a big sigh and were obviously not happy to let me in, but hey it's a plane right? No one's really happy on a plane. I didn't think much of it.\n\nThe flight was about 4.5 hours long so I settled in, no issues yet. As we are about 45-50min away we can see some of the city we're landing in, but we're still on top of the clouds and it's super bright in my eyes. I stick it out for a bit but eventually have to lower the shade because the sun in bouncing off the clouds and is just uncomfortable for me. A minute or so after I close the shade the lady next to me taps me on the shoulder (I had headphones on) and asks that I re-open the shade. I politely tell her sorry, the sun is really bright in my eyes so I won't open it back up, put my headphones back on and think that's it. The lady taps me again on the shoulder and angrily informs me that they paid money for the flight and to open my window. I again say sorry, not going to do it, and next thing I know she's leaning over me trying to open the shade. By instinct I block her arm I turned to her and say \"sorry, if you wanted to see out the window you should have sat in this seat\" She looks shocked that I had blocked her arm and starts to protest again and I say again, \"if you wanted the window you should have sat in this seat\", and put my headphones back on. \n\nHere's the part where I'm not sure if I am TA - I had been planning on putting the shade back up once we were out of the cloud bank, but being petty I decided not to. If she hadn't have gotten angry or literally thrust her arm across my body I probably would have re-opened it for them. I feel like she had the opportunity to guarantee an open window and she chose not to take it. But I can kinda see her point of paying for the flight just the same as I, but idk if that justifies her actions.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for not raising the window shade so the ladies can see out of them? \n\ntl;dr - flight too bright, l turn off the light, lady starts fight, was I in the right?",

My brother and i are super close despite the 7 year age gap. He tells me everything. \n\nSo one night in my room we were playing video games together and it got brought up in conversation. It rarely comes up so i told him i wanted to tell him something, that it was very important and that he couldn't tell anyone. I explained to him that he is my stepdad, and that ive never met my real dad. I explained to him we are still the same and still brother and sister and that it doesnt make a difference. He told me that all makes sense and he wouldnt tell anyone. \n\nIt was all good and it felt good to tell him as i never talk about the situation to anyone. Yesterday i told my mom that i told him and she got livid. She told me it was not my place whatsoever, and that he was way to young to hear about that. She said i was completley out of line and its her job not mine. I told my mom that shes hardly told me anything about the other side of my family so thats not fair and he had a right to know. Its about me and not her. But shes so mad. Shes always been super sensitive on the topic of my dad and gets so emotional about it that i never ask anymore even though i strongly want to meet the other side of my family \n\nI havent talked to her about it but now that i think about it, it is her son and if she thinks he shouldn't have known then maybe he shouldnt have known. I think he is fine. He isnt scarred or sad or confused. I felt like he was plenty old and mature. We tell each other everything anyway. But did i go too far?\n\nEdit: Im his big sister\n\nEdit 2: Ive never called my step dad \"dad\" always by his first name",

He didn’t say where and he mentioned when but in broad strokes like “at the end of the week” \nToday I (and the rest of the driving members of my family) receive a call from my dad asking us to drive to a town thirty minutes away to pick him up. \nWhile this is certainly an inconvenience, especially since my sister is back in town for all of 2 days and we are spending that time driving we decide to help him out. \nUpon arriving, we discover that he is only just starting the process and then he ghosts us as we drive around looking for him/ a location to eat. As we approached the hour mark of this journey the discussion turned to just driving home and leaving my dad to his own devices. \nSo, the question is this, would we be dicks for leaving someone that was inconsiderate even when we chose to make the drive?",

    "title": "AITA for sunbathing nude on my own property?",
    "body": "I am an overweight mid-30s woman.  I enjoy being nude outside, not for sexual reasons, but like an old hippie. I live in a city apartment so cannot go nude outside. I go home to my parent's lake house 2-3 times a year, and if my family and their direct neighbors are not home, I will usually go outside naked starting around dusk, having a nice naked bonfire or sitting on the dock in the dark.  My parents are aware that I do this and have no issue with it - and I warn them if the deer-sighting camera goes off unexpectedly so they can delete the evidence.\n\nToday, however, it was just a beautiful day out and I wanted to do some sunbathing.  I'm usually home in the cooler months so can't partake in this.  I brought a chair and a book out to the firepit, lit a fire, and reclined in the sun.  The house is on a semi-private lake (public boat access, no public beaches, no-wake rule so only fishing boats really) and is located in a small bay.  There are 4 houses in the bay; ours is the third one in.  There are only two spots in the yard you can really see the lake right now because of the trees - directly off the dock, and a clearing about 6 feet wide that points out to the main lake.  The bay is shallow and full of weeds; in 10 years, I've only ever seen one person fishing in it.  The area across from the houses is marshy and uninhabited.  The clearing is small enough and the bay is remote enough that I assumed people wouldn't see me - you're usually not looking onto the shore when you're fishing.  \n\nI guess I was wrong though!  When I went to set up my fire, I noticed I could see a fishing boat through the clearing, and I know the \"if you can see them, they can see you\" line of thought, so I got my fire and everything ready with my towel still on, and didn't remove it until I was reclined in the chair, with my back directly towards the clearing so minimal visual access.  At that time the boat was no longer there.  About 20 minutes later, I heard a motor and looked, and the same boat was back in the clearing - far enough out that I couldn't see faces but close enough that I could tell there were 2 middle-age men in the boat.  I drifted back to sleep.  A short time later, I heard the 'klunk' of something hitting my dock, so I sat up confused and grabbed my towel.  \n\nIt was the same fishing boat, who had motored over to yell at me.  They said it was illegal for me to be naked outside; I said no, I'm on my own private property, and our state doesn't have rules against it anyway.  They said they found it distracting while they were fishing, I said sorry but that's not my fault, and they said they were going to report me to the DNR for interfering with their fishing.  I shrugged and said sorry, hope you have a better day, and out of politeness gathered my things and went inside.  They boated away and I haven't seen them on the lake since.\n\nI don't feel I did anything wrong, and I tried to be respectful (covered when walking around, faced my chair away from the lake), but AITA for being naked outside today?",

    "title": "AITA for selling my house that I bought with my inheritance money if my mom is upset about it",
    "body": "3 years ago, my adoptive mom helped me buy a house with my inheritance from when my adoptive dad passed away.  I was told by her that this was my inheritance and that when I was ready to sell it and move somewhere else she would be fine with it. Now she is listed as the secondary owner just in case anything happened to me.  So she has to sign off on anything to do with selling the house unfortunately. Recently I decided it was time for me to move on with my life and sell the house so my fiancee and I can buy our first house together.  He's putting just as much into this as I am but my mom has done nothing but throw roadblocks in our plans. At first she was refusing to sign but after several conversations signed the papers to list the house. At this point she was saying it was her money and not my inheritance like she originally said. As the primary owner the money from the house will go to me though. Today I approved an offer for the house and now need her to sign more papers confirming the sale before the final closing paperwork. When I called to let her know, she said I can't have all the money from the sale. She's saying I can only have about half. I'm upset about the whole thing because we had plans for every bit of the money we get from the sale. Every time I talk to her she acts like I owe her for taking me in as a child. Am I the asshole for wanting to sell the house and keep all the money?\n\nTLDR; I want to sell my house but my mom refuses to let me without taking half the money or refusing to sign even though it's my inheritance money that bought the house\n\nUpdate on how this all panned out: unfortunately she did take half the money from the sale of the house and we have not spoken since signing the closing papers.  Me and the other half ended up getting a domestic partnership before buying our new house so we are both protected in case of one of us leaving the other for those of you who were concerned about me and my boyfriend buying a home together. We were still able to buy the place we wanted and we just closed on it a little under a week ago so we are doing fine even with everything that happened with this whole ordeal. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice and commented on this!",

    "body": "A little bit of a rant because this just keeps happening.\n\nFor context - I don't live with my parents anymore, but I'm visiting them at least twice a month because they're my parents and I like hanging out with them.\n\nThey own a pretty neat TV system so sometimes I when I visit them I plopp down on the couch and enjoy some Netflix in my pyjamas. \n\nNow to my issue: My mom likes to sit down next to me and watch parts of the movie with me, I enjoy that. But on more than one occasion, she just does loud things, including turning her phone to 'loud mode' so you can hear every tip and notification on her cell phone, she has phone conversations while sitting there, she watches videos people send her on whatsapp.\nAnd everytime I told her: I don't mind you being on the phone while watching a movie with me but just try to be quiet so I can focus, and everytime she tells me \"you're being a mean and egoistic person for saying so\"\n\nToday she hit the final straw by bringing her laptop and watching minute long recordings from old family holidays. I repeatedly asked her to either put headphones in or turn it down, or, if it's important to her, watch it in her room, or even wait until the movie is over so I can watch them with her, to which she again, replied \"you can be so mean sometimes\" and \"it's my house so I can do what I want\" and \"why is this such a problem it's not like you can't see the movie anyway?\"\n\nI didn't think I was being mean, I just told her I think it's really impolite to do that while someone is watching a movie (especially since it was one of my favorites, planet of the apes, which she knows!)\n\nShe's currently not talking to me because of that and I seriously considering going back to my place because the mood is ice cold because of that.\n\nSo, TL;DR:  WIBTA by repeatedly asking my mom not to be loud in her house while I was watching a movie?\n\nEdit: I appreciate that all of you took the time to respond - sometimes you think your view on things is the right and pragmatic one even though it isn't.\n\nI'd just like to clarify something that was brought up in the comments: No, I don't visit my parents just to watch TV. Most of the time is filled with talking, eating together and asking how everyone has been. The movie watching is something I generally do in the evenings, when everyone kind of does their own thing.\n\nThis doesn't change that my behaviour was apparently rude, so i'll try to talk to her and apologize.\n\nThank you all, reddit-people!",

    "body": "I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. \n\nHowever, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).\n\nSo it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while. But at the same time I've been here much longer and it's always been fine, so I don't want to have to change my habits for their sake, especially since they haven't said anything directly to me and instead have been a little rude about it.\n\nWIBTA if I just kept smoking?

She's gotten acne that has left these reddish/brownish marks on her cheeks and chin that won't fade. It has been destroying her confidence recently as she has decided to not meet up with friends or be in any pictures because she hates the way her skin looks with the hyperpigmentation left behind. \n\nLast week, my relatives came over to celebrate Christmas with us and my mom wouldn't stop pointing out her acne marks and scars to our relatives and constantly would tell everyone to not let Alya eat sugar. At one point, my grandmother made these \\*AMAZING\\* cookies and Alya was about to eat one and my mom went, \"NO! DON'T EAT THAT! DO YOU WANT YOUR SKIN TO GET WORSE? THIS IS WHY YOUR SKIN IS SO BAD.\"\n\nAlya instantly retracted her had and looked completely humiliated. When I was around her age, I also had to deal with acne that left marks on my face and it demolished my confidence. I had always wished I had something to coverup my scars when I was going out. I decided to take it upon myself to buy her a little bit of foundation to help her.\n\nMy mom is a firm believer in natural remedies and won't let Alya use anything that isn't [this face mask](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwil7oflgOjmAhVSneAKHUdiAasQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCauvery-Natural-Sandal-Herbal-Grams%2Fdp%2FB01GF89B78&psig=AOvVaw3i0riF1yIOfuF-dr-m0QVB&ust=1578160672626903) on her face and insists that she puts a crushed tomato on her face everyday. I believe that these remedies might eventually work, but they'll take a lot of time and I wanted her to have something that could help her cover it up now. My mom is also very vocal about not wearing makeup if you have acne, but I don't think she understands how much Alya's acne is bothering her. \n\nI bought Alya some good quality foundation and she was super happy with it. She wore it when we were taking New Years pictures and my mom noticed and flipped out. She was angry with me going against her wishes and said that I was further ruining Alya's skin. I feel really bad for going against what my mom wanted, but at the same time, I feel like I'm helping Alya out by doing something that will help her confidence. \n\nTL;DR - MY sister has a lot of acne scars and my mom won't let her cover it and constantly brings up her acne. I decided to buy her foundation and my mom flipped out and said I was ruining her skin.",

I know Americans love their pets and see them as family but its just not how I was raised. Anyway this took place a year ago when I was working at a call center for an unnamed cable company. It was the night shift when I got a call from this lady who was in the verge of tears, judging from her voice was about in her late 20's to early 30's saying that she needs to get in touch with whoever it was that came to her house to install her cable because she thinks he let her cat out. \n\nNow I work in the billing department that deals with billing discrepancies, and I had no idea what to  do in this situation. I prompt her for her account info to access her account but she claimed she was too angry to remember them. I run to my manager to explain the situation and ask her what to do. My manager informed me that we can't do anything for her since she can't remember her account info, furthermore even if we could access her account there's no way to get in touch with the person that came to her house as the records aren't that detailed. Basically she was shit out of luck. I relay what my manager told me to the lady as calmly as I could. And she went from crying to straight up screaming, demanding to speak with my manager. I told her I can't do that since I've already gave her the response my manager would give her and she'll only tell her what I just told her. She still kept screaming at me. Through her shouting I tried to get  it through to her that there really was nothing we could have done.\n\nTo which she replied with \"REALLY? IF YOUR SON WAS MISSING HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO?\" and here's where I may have messed up.

    "title": "AITA for not letting my mother move in with me and my bf?",
    "body": "So, a little bit of background. My mother and my stepdad recently purchased a property in my city, where my mother plans on living in a tiny house. However, in addition to the tiny house, she would need a permanent address, as well as a place to do laundry, shower and store her things. Also, when it gets too cold in the winter she would live there. So, my parents have been looking for a suitable place (it ought to be ideally freshly renovated) for a really low price. So far they haven't had much luck.\n\nToday my mother called me to make me an \"offer\". She wants to come to my place to shower and do laundry 3x a week and live here a maximum of 2 months per year. In exchange, she wants to give me her expensive new living room furniture and a new kitchen, (which are things she insits on having in my flat, even though I have a kitchen and furniture which I would have to throw out). Also, because my flat is not up to her standards, she wants to renovate it (put in new tiles, paint etc.). Now, we did not intend on renovating the flat and also don't need furniture, however in exchange for these things she would like to have my bf's current bedroom rent free for the first 9 months and then pay 50% at the beginning of next year.\n\nNow, if my bf and I had intended to renovate the flat and needed new furniture this would be a great deal, but honestly living in a pile of rubble for months while they renovate my flat and then having my mother come live with us for two months in the winter just doesn't strike me as a good deal. My bf and I love living alone, since this is the first time we are able to live without additional roommates. Also our flat is quite small and my mother does not work, which means in the winter she might be here for two months constantly. She also wants to bring her cat, who is used to being outside 12 hours a day, and she can't go outside where we live.\n\nI thought my parents would understand that the deal they were offering me just wasn't that good for me. Yes, the furniture is expensive but I don't need expensive furniture and I can live in this flat without fresh paint on the walls. However, when I told them no just now they said that they were \"extremely disappointed\", because they apparently thought I would jump at this offer. Now, I feel like I am being harsh telling them that I don't want to live with my mother, even if it is only two months a year tops. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So, a few people asked why she can't have a shower in her tiny house. The property she purchased is in a garden community. It is only meant to be a garden, which means there is no sewage there. She could probably figure out how to have a shower without gas, but without sewage, the water wouldn't have anywhere to go. ",

Usually when presented with the \"does it make me look fat\" question, I avoid it and find something else wrong with the outfit (clashing colors, too racy for work, not your style, etc. etc.)  This morning my wife asked me if a blue summer dress made her look fat.  I sidestepped and said \"I like that dress, it matches your eyes.\"  The dress is one of those with the seam directly below the bosom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt lunch, a female acquiescence hailed us and asked if my wife was expecting. My wife said no and then started crying after the encounter.  I held her and said I was sorry that had happened.

    "body": "I have been best friends with a girl since we were 12. We are now almost 30. We've had our arguments but always come out the other side. When we were teenagers we were never apart. We were always out drinking, partying, shopping etc. Over the past 7 years we have drifted as I'm not in to that lifestyle anymore yet she is and she has done mannnnny questionable things such as having an affair and has always used me as her cover story without me knowing until a day or so after. Around a year ago, she rings me absolutely petrified, saying she thinks she is pregnant. I reassured her that whatever her decision, she would be absolutely fine and that I'll help her in any way that I can. A week later she calls and says that the news has settled in and she's keeping the baby. I congratulate her. We didn't see each other much during her pregnancy but kept in touch often. I helped to organise her baby shower with her other best friend and spent a fair amount of money on the shower and present. The whole time I was there I was made to feel really awkward and as if I'd been invited just because we had been friends for so long, not because we are actually friends. I kept asking to see her scan pictures as she'd been for a 3D scan and she kept brushing it off but then I saw her showing other people. I made my excuses and left after about 2 hours. I messaged her a few days later and no reply. I continued to attempt contact every few days for the next 9 weeks until I went on Facebook one day and saw that her baby boy had been born 3 weeks early, 3 weeks prior to her posting her news on Facebook. This absolutely knocked the wind out of me because I was finding out on Facebook that my best friend had given birth 3 weeks earlier and I had no clue about it. I still to this day have not had a response from her and I have not liked/commented etc on any of her posts since therefore by default, I have not acknowledged the baby. I am absolutely heartbroken that she didn't feel our years of friendship meant anything to her a mere 30 something weeks after she rang me crying because she'd found out she was pregnant. \n\nAm I the asshole for ignoring what's going on in her life when she clearly doesn't want me involved? Am I the asshole if I remove her from all social media and carry on with my life without her in it?",

It was an emotionally abusive relationship. We both hurt each other a lot. It’s been a few years and I got over it, and so did he.  We talk strictly as acquaintances, and we talk a few times a week. That’s it. The other day, he came to me to vent about his new gf and their problems. He asked me to not bring up our past. I said I wouldn’t . I listened to him and offered advice on what to do. I told my boyfriend and he got upset. I even offered to show him the messages to reassure him. He said no and just continued looking upset. Now whenever I’m on my phone, he looks at what I’m doing to see if I’m talking to him. I don’t mind that because i don’t want to hide anything from him.

While as an Indian man I may have a slightly higher tolerance to spice, butter chicken is *not* a spicy dish; it’s in the name: I put in lots of butter and cream. Sure, the recipe called for garam masala, but I insist that those were not the overwhelming flavours of the dish. Anyway, once I realised it was nothing serious, I laughed and said that was the risk of living with an Indian, and that if she opened my shelf there was a naan she could have because bread was better for the spice than water.

    "body": "Growing up, I had amazing grandparents. They were super involved in our lives, babysat regularly, and had sleepovers at their house all the time. They even took us on a couple trips. This was my normal. As I got older, my parents made comments about looking forward to being grandparents some day and after I got married, they were always wondering when a baby was coming (not in an obnoxious way). They even put in a pool in their back yard to “prepare for the next stage of life.”\n\nThen, I had a baby. Comments made by them in the past had me thinking that my mom would be willing to watch the baby while I worked part time. She said she didn’t feel up to it, and thought daycare would be a better fit. Sure, ok. Then, I’d call and ask them to babysit for whatever reason, and they were usually busy, or not feeling well, or tired, or some other excuse. I tried talking to them about it, and they said “we enjoy babysitting, but we like spending time with all of you the most.” Ok...\n\nMy oldest is 10 now, and he has spent the night at their house once, and they have babysat probably 15 times total. When he was 3, his father and I divorced. The lack of babysitting and interest in his life wasn’t as noticeable because he was at his dad’s house half the time. I remarried and had another baby 2 years ago. The trend has continued. They see us about once every 2-3 months and have babysat twice. I asked if they could watch the kids while my husband and I went on a weekend getaway, and they said that they don’t think it would be a good idea. “It’s too tiring.” (They are still in their 50’s, and my dad is prepping now for his second marathon. They are more active and fit than I am.)\n\nI’ve tried to accept that they are just not interested, but it’s hard. My friends all drop their kids off for weekends with grandma all the time. My mom’s best friend hosts “camp grandma” once a year, complete with matching shirts and trips to theme parks. It’s so sad to me that my kids won’t ever get that. \n\nSo, reddit, AITA? I’m honestly hoping that if I am being an asshole, someone can provide me some logic that will convince me to stop feeling this way. I don’t want to resent them, but I can’t seem to get there on my own.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I know I could hire a babysitter. We do. It’s not the money. We are lucky enough to have well paying jobs that make our lives comfortable. I just want *them* to want to do it. Ugh. It’s hard to explain why it’s so hard for me to accept that they don’t.",

    "body": "A bit of clarity: I don't refuse to acknowledge it or abstain from partaking in celebration entirely, however, my family has always kept all holidays and celebrations pretty low-key. Usually the standard celebration for any given holiday (xmas, bdays, etc) involves a gift + card and maybe dinner out. So as an adult, my approach to celebrating holidays is also very low-key. \n\nTheir anniversary is coming up soon (it's not a milestone or anything) and as usual, we're going out to dinner as a family to celebrate. But my schedule conflicted with the actual date of their anniversary, so we moved the dinner to the following night because they wanted me to still join them for dinner, which is great!\n\nBut my dad called me and was agitated that now he has to wait an extra day to give mom her gift since I'm not there, and he said he'd sign her \"happy anniversary\" card from the both of us, and they've strongly implied I should be arriving with gifts as well and treating them to dinner.\n\nThey're like this every year, and they always get offended when I don't arrive with a gift from me to each of them separately, or when I don't take the lead on the celebration by paying for their dinner, and I always felt weirded out when I'm made to sign the sentiment cards, which are overtly romantic and explicitly directed to the person you're *married* to. \n\nThe thing is, I don't feel like it's my place. This isn't \"my\" celebration; I am not really part of it. An anniversary is about the two people who have married each other, and their enduring relationship. It's fine for them to include me in their celebration, as I am family and I have no problem joining them for dinner and wishing them a happy anniversary, but mainly it should be between and about the two of them. \n\nSo, I don't feel it's appropriate to give my mother an anniversary gift from myself, because I'm not the one married to her! I don't think I should be expected to give a card, nor does my name have any place as a signature on the ones they give to each other. My presence has no bearing on when they exchange their gifts, and while I suppose my buying their dinner would be a generous gesture on my part, they always choose expensive steakhouses and such that are way out of my budget, as a broke college student, and aren't willing to compromise. Plainly put, I can't afford steak-and-lobster dinners for 3. \n\nYet, they frequently take the position that I'm being aloof and selfish and it's *their* \"special day\" so I should be doing what they want and making it special for them! I think that even if I am a result of their marriage, I have nothing to do with their marriage, and it should be enough that I acknowledge their anniversary (\"Happy anniversary!\") and accept their invitation to dinner, since it has been awhile since I saw them. We dont always have the best relationship so perhaps I'm letting their other antics in my life color my perspective on what I think is appropriate social protocol for celebrating other people's anniversaries, but AITA after all?",

I didn't see Mark again until the wedding and at the reception, we really hit it off we drank and danced together all night long all in all it was a night to remember. Later we connected on facebook and went on a date.\n\nFamily members were initially worried simply because if things went awry it could possibly result in family drama but Mark and I shrugged off their concerns, we figured we were both mature enough to deal with a break up amicably if the time ever came but we both thought that our relationship would last forever. But...unfortunately, our relationship started to break down. When I moved in with Mark in 2017 that's when money really started to become an issue for both of us.\n\nTo make a long story short: I started finding myself frustrated with Mark's poor spending habits and financial planning but I thought things would get better once he moved in and I would be able to guide his spending habits. That's not how it worked out, we argued a lot over finances and that's when the breakdown of our relationship truly started.\n\nIn 2018 I noticed Mark had become more distant toward me. He was on his phone *a lot* during this time which I was concerned about because he was never the type of man to use his phone constantly. In October things came to a head when I saw him tagged in some risque photos on Instagram of him at a Halloween party with some woman I had never seen before, when I confronted him about it he admitted to cheating and apologized profusely but I was done I told him to pack his shit and leave and that I never wanted to see him again. I never saw Mike again until July of this year (2019.)\n\nEvery year my parents have this huge family reunion where practically everyone who's related is invited. I had told my parents about Mark so I didn't quite expect him to be there but low and behold I see him with Linda and James laughing it up and drinking a beer. Immediately, I see red and storm up to Mark asking him where does he get off showing up at my parents home after what he did to me? He said that he was sorry for what happened and just wanted to stop by to say hello to some folks and get some free food. I absolutely lost it, and at that moment I threw my plate of potato salad and mac and cheese in his face. I walked away feeling great but the next day it resulted in text message after text message of family members absolutely mortified at what I did. I do feel bad but my parents shouldn't have invited Mark over, they knew what he did to me so I feel a bit justified in my reaction. So AITA for causing a scene?",

This alone wouldn’t be the issue, as they’re pretty well-behaved otherwise and get off when I tell them to for things like family dinner.\n\nRecently, however, I decided to check the internet reports from my internet provider online and discovered that my daughter’s phone and computer were using WiFi until past four in the morning. This, to me, is absolutely ridiculous, but when I confronted her about it, she said it didn’t matter if she was staying up that late since she woke up late, and therefore got a normal eight hours of sleep. I responded by saying that summer was almost over, and shifting back to a schedule where she would have to wake up early for school wouldn’t happen overnight, so I said that until she started sleeping normally, I was disabling internet for the devices she uses.

I think it’s a reasonable rule since I’m more concerned than angry, but my wife says that two weeks is still a while, and that she’s getting more sleep now than she ever did on school nights anyways. AITA?\n\nEdit: It’s only turned off at night\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for your input everyone, I wasn’t 100% sure initially because technically she is getting a full 8 hours of sleep but I’m going to turn the internet off at night until she gets back to a normal schedule",

First they tried half-time but it didn't help, panic attacks and anxiety started to manifest every other day so shes on sick-leave for 3 months and has no energy to do anything most days...In short.\n\nMe I'm going to a different path, after a electrician education goes thru military training, get a temp-job as a security guard and stay there to clime up the ladder so i get a full-time job at the best position in the company it took 6 years to get where i am today.. And i love it! Basically I sit at a reception during nighttime and play video-games with friends thru internet and scroll reddit and netflix :D It's the most lazy job on the planet and because its all nighttime i make above average pay and more then any of my friends have.\n\nThe only downside I work every other weekend and is 12 hour shifts.\n\nThis means 2 weekend a month she is home alone with our kid and I'm only with my family a few hours, it tough but it's my job and I have come to accept it.\n\nShe however doesn't, she thinks i should take almost any job that includes daytime and no weekends.. regardless of pay or working environment. Just because she needs my support during weekends. I understand it's hard but should i sacrifice all that I've worked for?\n\nShe gets mad every time we talk about it and starts to tear up.\n\nAm not all that against changing my job but i at least want a job that i might like or I'm worried I might get depressed.\n\nI'm trying to support her the best i can when I'm not at work, making dinner, cleaning, laundry. etc. But some days i feel like I'm the only parent taking care of my kid and my GF and the household all alone..\n\nAITA for not wanting to help her? Everyone i asked just says it's a hard one..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\n\\*My GF is going through therapy and taking anti-depression pills.\n\n\\*My kid is about to turn 3 years old.\n\n\\*Because I work 12/h shifts I only work on about 12-14 days a month",

    "title": "AITA for leaving a bad review after a refund?",
    "body": "This happened a while ago but has been bugging me ever since. I bleached my hair and it was in bad condition. I booked an appointment at a hairdresser's. At the appointment I asked for my hair to be dyed my natural colour and cut short. I also asked for lowlights but didn't realise this wasn't possible and ended up not getting them (I maybe expected too much). During the appointment she complained repeatedly about my hair being in bad condition and I kept apologising. She didn't speak to me about anything else.  The hairdresser matched my hair but then when she dyed it my hair was too dark and too warm. The dye also didn't work on the ends so it looked awful, a half dye. The hairdresser said nothing so I paid and tipped her as I felt like I had been so much work from her complaining.\n\nOver the week I used a shampoo toner to try and cool the colour but all that happened was the bleached parts turned purple. I called the salon and they told me the hairdresser was independent and it had to be her who fixed it (I later contacted the citizen's advice bureau and they confirmed that the salon should I have fixed it as I booked it through them). When I got there she roughly grabbed at my hair and then started laughing at how bad it looked.\n\nI'm ashamed to say that I jumped up from sitting and snapped at her, asking why she was laughing. Someone else said it was because she was nervous but she had looked to be smirking to me. She offered to try to fix it but didn't seem very confident about it and said if she had dyed my hair my natural colour it would have gone green (but didn't say this when she dyed my hair or I would have done it myself). She claimed the dark colour would matched when it grew up but it was dark brown and my colour is dark blonde. I told her I had tipped her because she made me feel so bad but she just grabbed my hair and said \"but it is broken\" like it made it ok. I got a full refund (including tip) and angry glares as I left but no apology.\n\nWhen I got back I was pretty upset about how she had treated me both times. I wrote a long review on their Facebook page and tried to be clear I was annoyed by the hairdresser's attitude and \\*not\\* the hairdye itself (I knew my hair was in bad condition). I also mentioned that I felt sorry for snapping at her. Immediately the hairdresser's friends reacted with angry faces and said I was lying and trying to ruin her business. I tried to respond to them but it just made it worse. They also left about ten separate positive reviews for the hairdresser with snide comments about \"people\" who have bleached hair. I got no reply from the hairdresser or salon. Eventually my account was locked and the review disappeared (it was a new account as I don't use facebook and with a fake name).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've wondered ever since if I was the asshole for snapping at her and then for leaving a negative review after being refunded. It seems everyone else really likes the hairdresser so I don't understand what happened with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: More details\n\nEdit 2: Someone seems to have downvoted everyone. This was not me. Thanks everyone for replying.",

I've known my roommate for almost 10 yrs, and I was practically raised in his house. We moved in together 3 yrs ago, we have a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nOn the 4th of July, my roommate's brother shows up to drop Amy off at our apartment, apparently my roommate was supposed to be babysitting this time around but he buggered off to his girlfriend's house, later claiming he forgot. So I offered to babysit instead. Amy's parents were throwing a bachelor's party at their house for a friend. They were supposed to pick Amy up at 11 PM, but there was a incident, cops got involved. They asked if she could stay the night at my house. I accepted. \n\nMy roommate locks his bedroom door when he leaves because the latch doesn't work and my dogs (I have 3) will get in there and mess with his stuff, so his bed was out of the question. The living room only has 2 arm chairs and a bean bag chair, so neither of us could sleep in there. So we ended up in my king size bed together.

    "title": "AITA for refusing to make my dad's phone calls?",
    "body": "Growing up, my dad always treated me as his personal secretary. Usually, it was making phone calls for him. He'd never ask, he'd just say, \"Go get the phone and call Carl and tell him I can't come to his barbecue this weekend.\" I HATED this, because I was very shy, and I'd always end up going back and forth between my dad telling me what to say and telling him what his buddy was saying on the phone, which was stressful as fuck (my parents also made me the messenger between them whenever they would fight, so this is a bit of a raw nerve). But of course, as a kid, I couldn't tell him no.\n\nImportant detail: My dad recently got a cell phone. He immediately taped over the selfie cam, claiming that the government would use it to spy on him, but then gets pissed when he tries to put the phone on speaker and can't because the proximity sensor keeps preventing him from pressing the button (the tape covers the sensor, and I've explained this several times). He refuses to use anything but speaker, because he believes having the phone near his head will cause cancer.\n\nAnyway, today, I got a phone call from him while I was in the middle of cooking dinner. He told me his house phone wasn't working, and he wanted to find out if it was just his house or others. Then he said, \"I need you to call my workplace and my girlfriend and then call me back to tell me if the phones are working.\"\n\nThis irritated the FUCK out of me, because I'm almost 30 and he's telling me--not asking me--to make these calls for him. I'm ESPECIALLY not comfortable with calling his girlfriend because 1) that's awkward as fuck, and 2) I've only met her in passing and spoken to her once.\n\nThat said, I was polite and said, \"Dad, no offense, but can you call them instead? You're already on the phone.\"\n\nHe told me he couldn't because he didn't want to call and them hear him struggle with putting speaker on. I asked why he couldn't just keep speaker off, and I got the \"There's no way I'm putting this phone near my head.\"\n\nSo I plainly said, \"Dad, I really don't want to call your girlfriend.\" I started to explain that I was in the middle of something, but he cut me off and started SCREAMING at me. \"JESUS CHRIST, I'M ASKING YOU TO DO ONE LITTLE THING, BUT FINE, WHATEVER, I'LL DO IT LIKE I ALWAYS DO, AND I'VE HAD A REALLY SHITTY DAY, AND [proceeds to rant and rave about a bunch of things that have nothing to do with me making his calls for him].\"\n\nBy the end of that, I decided maybe compromise was the best option (because his rant made me feel like an asshole), and I offered to call his work for him, but not his girlfriend. He didn't like that either, but eventually agreed. I hung up, called his work (it didn't connect), and then texted him to let him know. He wrote back about how he probably wouldn't be able to reach his girlfriend because of his phone issue but \"that's fine I guess.\" (He did end up calling and getting a busy signal.)\n\nSince I became an adult, I started telling him no when he'd ask tell me to do this kind of stuff, and everytime, he'd either be super passive aggressive towards me about it, or try to guilt trip me. That's why I didn't really react to his rant about his super stressful day. It's not just phone calls either... it's telling me to order him stuff online (because he doesn't want Amazon to have his address) or paying his phone bill for him (because he doesn't want the phone company to have his bank account/card number). I love my dad very much and would love to help him with stuff, but sometimes it's ridiculous. He does the whole \"I'll never ask for a favor again\" BS when I say no, but of course a week or so later, he's back to it.\n\nAITA for saying no? :(\n\nTL;DR - Dad doesn't ask but tells me (almost 30) to make phone calls for him like some sort of secretary, and becomes passive aggressive and guilt trips me when I say no.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I guess he's been successful in guilt tripping me, and you're right, I need to stop enabling this behavior. I appreciate the outside perspective.",

So his friends during that time, consisted of people who didn't study and used to drink (they were underage). During this time, he met a girl, who broken up with her boyfriend, after getting cheated on. He decided to \"help\" her by dating her.

We are all in our final year apart from one guy (lets call him Joe) who is doing a sandwich year which means he started in the same year as us but is currently doing an internship this year, and will graduate next year. He actually lives closer to his work but makes an effort to come over for parties and dnd, and usually ends up crashing on our couch.\n\nNow our dungeon master (Lets call him Bob) is a great dungeon master but a kinda control freak in all aspects of his life. I've never really seen eye to eye with him but my boyfriend is good friends with him. The one thing he hates is people last minute cancelling plans, which I 100% understand most of the time, but I also know that life happens and sometimes not everyone can make it. Joe has actually always been pretty good with coming. He has had to cancel a couple of times but was able to give notice and we rearranged for a better time.\n\nYesterday I woke up to see a mess in our group chat. From what I can gather, Joe had to cancel for a last minute work trip. They are flying him out to the US today for a week, and he had just found out. He was estatic, however this meant he obviously wouldn't be able to make our session, and Bob lost his shit at him. Partly due to the last minute cancellation but I feel like something else might have happened because he is not normally a super angry person. Joe even said he was happy for us to play without him but Bob was not having that. He doesn't like people missing out on his story because he works hard on it.\n\nAnyway, I tried to defuse a little in a different group chat with everyone and a couple of others in, just saying how happy I was for Joe because I knew he wanted to go for a while and stuff, but in the original Dnd chat everyone else was kind of aggresive and taunting saying things like \"Ah, we're going to miss you Joe.\", \"We had a good campain, your character was fun to play with\" and stuff like that as if its already established that he would no longer be welcome at these sessions. I tried again to calm people down saying it was just one session and it was a pretty good reason but people were like \"Nah, if Bob wants him gone, hes gone.\"\n\nMy own boyfriend who was right next to me admitted it was a bit harsh but said there was nothing he could do, but I wasn't taking that. I argued with Bob for a bit longer but he wasn't having none of it. He in the end said something along the lines of \"If you want to go play with Joe, then go. No one is making you turn up to these sessions. You're just the eye candy anyway\"\n\nThat last statement made me mad. The boys have always been super respectful to me playing with them. I really don't think siding with Joe was the wrong thing to do. He has done nothing wrong in my eyes. But seeing as not even my own bf will side with me I'm really sitting back wondering if the other guys have a point, or are they all just sucking up to Bob?",

She was a very free spirited, aligned with nature type, and from what I gather she used to cleanse crystals there, which was fitting because of the name. When she passed our family found a lot of solace and beauty in that location, it was always very positive and comforting to go there and it still is.

She had no idea about this, but my husband and I immediately looked at each other and knew it’d be perfect. I know my sister would love the idea. Well, when I told my mom, she lost it. She immediately got emotional and we got into a bit of an argument about how I could even think to name her grandchild that, and how it’s morbid and inappropriate.

We talked it through a ton and we were all excited and looking forward to experiencing it together. Fast forward to this morning, where I woke up feeling a little worse than usual (I’d been dealing with a cold for about 2 days and was hoping it would vanish by today) so I got up a little early and made myself some tea, took two teaspoons of cough syrup and even bundled up before heading outside to take the dog to pee. It’s around 10am at this point and I go to my sister and gently let her know that it might not be the best day since I was feeling really sick, but that I’d still try and make myself feel better so the possibility of us taking it could be there. She was immediately passive aggressive, was short with me and just refused to look in my general direction. I ascertained again that I’d try and make myself feel better, and left to make more tea. \n\nFast forward a couple of minutes and I knock on the bedroom door where my sister and her boyfriend are just to see how they’re feeling, and I asked if they still wanted to go to the store to pick up some fruits for the trip. Essentially, my sister angrily says she assumed the trip wasn’t happening, but I mentioned again I said earlier I’d try to make myself feel better. It broke down into her asking me if I thought her and her boyfriend were both babies and unable to take it on their own, and me trying to explain that that just wouldn’t be responsible of me and if it was their first time it would be better for them to have a sitter. I was really just trying to implore that it wasn’t the best time at that point since my sister was incredibly passive aggressive and bitter. She told me to leave her alone and I left. \n\nI know they’re both adults (sister [19]F and her boyfriend [20]M, and myself [22]F) and can take it on their own if they want to. My sister did send me a transfer to pay for their tabs but I just know it wouldn’t be wise to let them just go at it alone, especially with this tense and uncomfortable atmosphere.

    "body": "Okay so maybe this is gonna sound like I'm looking for validation but most of my friends say I'm in the wrong.\n\nMe and my Erik are both 16, and we write rap battles between our teachers in our spare time for fun. Our teachers love them as they're typically school appropriate, and we try our best not to make jabs between teachers too personal (not cracking jokes about a teacher's personal life, keeping it about what they show at school, the subjects they teach)\n\nRecently, Erik texted me two verses he wanted me to choose between, with verse 1 having the top line in it, verse 2 having the second:\n\n1. You can't think straight, even though I'm the queer\n2. You look like a horse, and I can't stand nickers\n\nI immediately told him I didn't approve of either, my reasoning being that I didn't feel comfortable using queer, since it means strange, and the second one is a joke about the N word.  I tell him why I'm against both and he responds \"Then why is it lgbtq, if they use it it's not offensive\" and \"It doesn't actually say the N word, it just sounds like it, it's fine.\"\n\nI tell him, again, that I'm not a fan of either line, that we can't use them if teachers are gonna read the raps. I also offer to help him come up with a new line if he can't think of anything, and that I like both the verses otherwise. A few minutes later, he tells me to decide between the two lines, he won't rewrite them because they're fine. I then copy the first verse onto the Google Doc, changing the line to something I believe to be a bit more suitable, though not a very strong line. I tell him what I did and he drops it there.\n\nLater, when I told a third friend what happened he said I was a bit of a dick and that Erik's first verse was fine originally. I thought it was fine because I told Erik I changed the line and, being an online document, we could always change it to something better, but thinking about it, maybe I'm letting my opinion cloud what others deem a good line? This isn't really about the second line, Erik tells me he sees how that one wouldn't fly, but he sees no problem with the use of queer, and neither does the third friend. Am I being the asshole here?",

    "body": "This has been bothering me for a few years, so here we go;\n\nA couple of years back I lived with my then-boyfriend in his apartment for 1 year to attend school in that city.\nI was unable to get a job during the time, so my only income was school support of DKR 900, or ~$135 pr month. Despite this, I agreed to pay half of all rent, bills and utilities, which totaled at around DKR 3000, or $450 month, if he payed for groceries. This meant that I had to use all my income, and payed the rest with my hard earned savings, which were meant to take me to Japan after graduating. I feel like it’s relevant, that during this, my ex himself was making DKR15000-18000/$2250-$2700 pr month, and therefor did not need my help to make ends meet. To help out I was also during the majority of the cleaning and shopping, as well as all the cooking and laundry.\nDespite knowing that I had a heavily negative income, he didn’t really get it, and talked me into buying lots of stuff, including (most expensively and the reason for this post) a shared PS4 when they came out.\nWhile we were dating, he offered a few times to pay me my half for it, but in my naive pride, I refused.\nI finished school and moved out to live at a boarding school about an hour away to study Japanese. During my first 6 months, he visited me once and never wanted to talk, and when seeing him at Christmas, I realized that I was hoping for him to break up with me. He did not, so I worked up my guts for about a month and after talking with some friends, I broke up with him in early February. He did not take it well, but was “nice” enough to return most of my things.\nAbout a month or two later, I remember the PS4, and text him asking for the money. He refuses. I then offer, despite still having a negative income, to buy my half then; again he refuses. This turned into a text fight, in which he claimed that since he payed groceries for a year, I actually owe him money for that, as well as rent and bills, even though I payed half for the time living there.\nEventually I gave up and tried to let it go, since I was distraught about it, but it’s always kept bothering me, so;\n\nWas ITA for asking for my ex for my half of the money back for the PS4?",

    "body": "So my 18 yo son is graduating HS today, he was supposed to be at the school at 9am and was only leaving the house at 8:40, about a mile from the house he calls and says he has a flat tire due to a screw he's known about for a while.  So I get off my conference call, go to get the air compressor and it's empty since he didn't plug it back up, so it takes a min to fill up.  I leave and get to him a few min later and he's turned around and DRIVES ALL THE WAY BACK HOME on a flat with me behind him honking and waving.  We get home, I'm like WTF, he says I was taking too long!  I'm pissed but start to put air in his tire, his hubcap, now cracked, was bent over the air plug so I ripped it off, and he freaks out, says it's always been cracked, to LEAVE IT FUCKING ALONE.  He starts pushing me aside trying to put it back on, I'm like 'stop, what are you doing?'  He has an anger issue btw.  So I toss the hubcap off to side and fill his tire up.  He says I broke it now, etc, gets in his car and takes off.  I look at my phone now and he sent a msg saying 'You're an asshole, don't fucking show up at my graduation, I can go a while without seeing you\".  And of course I had plans to meet the grandparents later and go together, get my other son, and meet his mom there too (we're divorced).  But really I just can't believe how volatile he is, I just spent over $1000 on his prom and graduation stuff and I know that's my job as his dad, but there is NO appreciation at all.  I was mad when I threw the hubcap but I don't think it deserves this type of reaction from him.  Should I even go now to his graduation?",

    "body": "I recently began dating this guy that I’ve been best friends with for about two years now. We’ve always had a crush on each other, but no one has acted on it, until now. It’s been only a month since we became official, but it already seems like he’s keeping something from me. This is my first “serious” relationship, (I’m 16, btw) and I don’t really know how this stuff works yet. \n\nSo on to the reason I believe he’s cheating/keeping something from me:\nLast weekend, he went over to some girls house that I do not know. While he was there, he’d take upwards of 3-4 hours at a time to respond to my snapchats, when he usually answers almost Instantly. I’m not one of those psychos that freak out if their SO doesn’t answer right away, but it was out of the ordinary for him. But whatever, I let him enjoy his time with her, although I was jealous. But I felt guilty for being jealous because he’s allowed to spend time with other people.\n\nWe have geography class together, and I sit next to him, and I could see a name on his Snapchat that I recognized. It was this girl I added a while ago. But the problem with this is that the name was changed to be her name, followed by two hearts. When you add her on Snapchat, the hearts are not there. \n\nHe also never lets me see his phone. I’ve noticed that whenever I touch his phone, he freaks. And when he uses it, he purposely points his screen away from me. \n\nAnd, he called my female best friend cute not too long ago. It made me uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. He also doesn’t treat me much different from his other friends. He has called me “babe” and “beautiful” a handful of times, but he mostly calls me “fam” or “bro”. It really bothers me, but it’s just a habit for him, as he always calls everyone that.\n\nAITA for thinking he’s cheating/uninterested in me? Or am I overthinking? \n",

She’ll stop for a few days but picks it up again. It’s gotten to the point where I have to shut my door if I want to get anything done, which sucks because we have an open-door policy. \n\nI know that getting my boss involved again isn’t the asshole move because my boss has done so before. What makes it a potential YTA is that our secretary is already the loner on our team for reasons unrelated to the above problem.  We have made every effort to include her in things like team lunches, inside jokes, etc. but she is just anti-social. We have given up and rarely make an effort to even speak to her if it’s not 100% necessary. We also complain about her in each other’s offices (whispering so she can’t hear us) because the quality of her work is mediocre at best and I often have to pick up her slack or redo her work completely.  I’m afraid that getting my boss involved again will only further ostracize her, thus making me the asshole.\n\nEdit: by office I really mean a super private cubicle so it’s not like she can close a door. We call it an office because she was sharing a cubicle with two other people at our last place, so this new one is a lot more private.",

When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.\n\nWe haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.\n\nWe (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.\n\nOur daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for \"abandoning\" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).\n\nAre we the assholes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just want to point out that we HAVE NOT had an \"I told you so\" moment with her where we make her feel bad for studying art.

My lease had come to an end and while I wasn’t planning on moving out at first I abruptly decided too after a few bad altercations with my roommate towards the end. \n\nWhen I decided to move out it was very last minute and didn’t give me time to save or find a new place. I had nowhere for me or my cat. So when my BFF(21F) and her roommate(23F) offered to take my cat I was beyond relieved. They said they would be happy to take her as long as I needed. \n\nWhen I moved my cat in I had brought her litter box, litter, food, toys, scratching post, etc. And I told my best friend that of course when she ran out of food and litter or anything I’d pay for more. \n\nSo her roommate fell absolutely in love with my cat and actually offered to buy her. I told her that I wasn’t really looking to give her up but if I couldn’t find a place that wouldn't allow cats she could have her for free. \n\nAfter about 2 months of me not finding a place the roommate made it clear she would be happy to start buying her litter and food and I could just pay her back whenever. I told her it was fine and that I had the money but she absolutely insisted. But anytime I tried to pay her back she would not accept it.\n\nAfter 4 months of me still not finding a place I found out the roommate had taken my cat to the vet without telling anyone. She saw my cat scooting on the carpet and assumed she had worms. If she had just asked me I would have told her she sometimes gets litter stuck to her butt and that’s her trying to get it off because I had already had her checked for the same reason. Even tho I saw no reason for the vet visit I still offered to pay her back because I appreciated her concern for my cat and she said it was alright. \n\nSo flash forward to today and I have just moved into my apartment yesterday and I want my cat back. So I texted my BFF I’m coming over to get my cat and so she tells her roommate. Her roommate then proceeds to tell her that she thought the cat was hers now and she won’t be giving it back. My BFF told her she wasn’t her cat but she then proceeds to lock my cat in her room so we can’t get her. \n\nWhen I got there she still refused to give me my cat. She told me because it’s been so long and she’s been taking care of the cat and paying for everything she has claim to it. I told her I’d pay her back for everything and for it’s care and she told me no she wants the cat. I told her no and she actually started fucking crying. She told me she just loved my cat so much and didn’t want to give her back. I ended up just saying she can stay her for the night but I’ll be back tomorrow to get my cat.\n\nI now feel bad because she had bonded with my cat so much but I love my cat, too and I want her back. I guess it has been a really long time but I was kinda being picky with apartments because they were happy to have her. AITA for wanting her back now?\n\nEDIT: I got my babes back!!!\n\n[Her names kyoko!](https://imgur.com/a/SB1VJ6J)",

Saw them at the social group and hung out with them again once or twice after that. Then I randomly got a late night (I'm thinking drunken) message about how we're not putting any effort into the friendship and we don't seem to be invested, we maybe knew this person for like a month at this point. I apologized saying it wasn't intentional and we'll do better. So we hung out with them a few more times, invited them to group outings, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later roommate and I were invited to a party by someone K didn't know, but a lot of people K met through this group went. K asked to hang out that day and I declined, saying I wasn't feeling it. Some of them posted about it on social media, which K saw and immediately messaged me asking if I was there, not wanting her to go off on me again I just lied and said I wasn't (which I'll admit was an asshole move). They apologized for making assumptions and we once again carried on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here's the thing about K, they seem to have a superiority complex and can be pretty mean. At a party, they made fun of people they had just met and stuck by my side pretty much the entire time. They went to a prestigious college and come from a wealthy family and they seem to bring that into conversation A LOT. Conversations with them can sometimes feel like a one-upping competition, and they can hold you hostage in conversation for a LONG time. Honestly, they're just a tough person to be around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey've also gotten a little clingy/obsessive with my and my roommate's friends. Picking up on similar interests (that they clearly didn't care about before), butting into conversations with them to talk about themselves, and inviting themselves to things/forcing friendship. Which I understand is part of getting to know people, but then they'll turn around and shit talk about them to me after. They're basically assuming that everyone wants to be friends with them, and they're being very aggressive in their pursuit while making other people really uncomfortable in the process (and some of my friends have said this). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's at the point where I feel like I can't do anything without them with \"mutual friends\" because they'll call me out for not inviting them, and when I do hang out with them in group settings they make the other people there uncomfortable or make a joke that goes too far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to end my friendship with this person?",

She doesn't drive.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago I put a stop to her asking me for things. This is what would happen... I would go to the store, come back home and see her riding around the neighborhood, she would see me get out of the car with groceries and say, \"Whyyyyyyyyy didn't you tell me you were going to the store?\". Next time, I would come back from CVS and she would say, \"Whyyyyyyyyyyy didn't you tell me you were going to CVS?\" I would tell her I'm sorry, I didn't know. And it actually started to piss me off. She did this multiple times to the point where I started looking out of my door before I left and I would peek into the neighborhood before I drove in, to make sure she wasn't there. It got that bad. In my opinion, I shouldn't have to check if she needs something every single time I go somewhere. So I told her exactly that. And she said that I was right. And then she kind of stopped saying that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thought was that she seems to be under the impression that I have to give her something just because she gives me something. BTW, I have no problem with giving her something. I have offered her money in exchange for the supplies and she doesn't want it. She wants me to basically run errands for her. Or take her to the store. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing about me: I take care of my mom 24/7 with barely a life of my own. And also suffer from anxiety. I just do not have the time to deal with an extra \"thing\". I do not care if I don't get supplies from her. It was a lot of help, but I don't think that I should have to worry about taking care of another person because of it. So, I just started buying the supplies myself this month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut am I the asshole for not wanting to do anything back for my neighbor? She is now acting really shady toward me and I'm just following her lead and not really talking to her back.",

Jen [sober] is crying. I was fed up with the night since 1) my sister had gotten belligerent earlier that night 2) I was too sober for this and 3) it was 1fuckingAM. My parents stepped in to diffuse the situation. My mom decided that she’ll drop Mike home and Jen will crash at my house. Everyone else cleared out.\n\nAfter comforting Jen a bit, we call it a night and go to bed. My SO KO’d, but I was still wired that I was unable to sleep. Very faintly, I hear knocking. I go downstairs and find Mike quietly talking to Jen. its 2am. Annoyed and angry, I asked what’s going on? He got an Uber over. Mike went from quiet to loud/aggressive. “I’m taking Jen home.” I told him that we weren’t gonna do this now and Jen wasn’t going home with him. Jen didn’t object. She told me earlier that she did not feel comfortable sleeping at the same house that night.\n\nEdging Mike out of my home, I told him that he shouldn’t have come. He should’ve stayed home and grabbed Jen in the morning. He’s standing outside my door at this point. He goes “really? You’re going to keep her in and kick ME out? Guess I’ll just walk home.” Okay. I closed my door and locked it. I figured that since he Uber’d over that he’d Uber back. He’s a big boy. He comes back a minute later. More knocking. “REALLY. YOU’RE GONNA MAKE ME WALK HOME?!” Told him “yes, you didn’t need to come back here at 2am and demand that Jen follow you home.” He texted me five minutes later, thanking me for making him walk home. I told him that he found a way over and he can find a way back. \n\nIf it means anything, I *did* hear earlier that day that he didn’t have much $ in his account, but that didn’t cross my mind at the time. Apparently, he did indeed walk home. Took him three hours. Now he’s angry at me because I didn’t allow him to crash at my house and he had to walk. AITA?",

    "body": "On mobile so possible formatting and grammar issues, sorry. It's probably important to note that I'm on the autism spectrum and can have a lot of issues with social cues and understanding cultural expectation type things.\n\nSo, I'm in America but pretty much the only holidays I kind of celebrate are new years, Valentine's, Thanksgiving, and Halloween. Mostly because I'm a really big fan of big meals and I have a sweet tooth. \n\nFor very many years now I haven't celebrated any of my family's birthdays, I haven't done Christmas, no father's or mother's day calls or gifts, etc, but my family always tries to force me into these things and refuses to respect that I don't want to do them. Its a bit that I'm a different religion from everyone else in my family but also just that all of those kinds of days feel really gross to me - just spending money because our culture says we suck if we don't, or calling a relative only because we're expected to, you know? Every year for almost a decade now they still ask what I want for my birthday or for Christmas and I always tell them nothing please it's been (x) years, please just respect this for once. And every year they're always annoyed that I don't want to be around during those kind of holidays for them to give me things and that I don't get them things. It's frustrating as hell.\n\nThey're starting to get more annoyed at me for not doing things like mother's and father's day too. I absolutely HATE doing phone calls and have really bad anxiety on top of just flat not wanting to, but they've tried to push me into calling family and wishing them happy mother's and father's days or calling them on their birthdays but I just really don't want to do it. It's so many awkward phone calls just so they don't think I hate them and so I don't think they're gonna be upset.\n\nBut like, I know that even if I don't celebrate these things they still do, and that to them it feels like I just don't want to celebrate them as a person I guess? AITA for not just participating in the gift giving and talking? How can I get them to lay off of me about not wanting to participate in things?\n\nEDIT for info: With all of the holidays mentioned besides Valentine's I'll go out to their houses and spend time with them then and talk, help cook and clean, and hang out. For Valentine's it's normally just me and my partner and very small things like stuffed animals as comfort items and I'll buy candy for us both because I just fucking love candy. I'll buy candy for us both year round but there's just so much more candy on Valentine's. \n\nI'm a Buddhist convert and the religious objection is a whole thing about the suffering caused by desiring objects and putting value in things that can break or make you feel bad etc, and I try to not even place that much value in the things I have, no matter how expensive. I think I explain it better in a reply I made. Really hard to explain my feelings about it without sounding pretentious I think. Expressing feelings in general isn't my strong suit.\n\nI also mentioned in a reply that with phone calls I'll ANSWER them but really don't make any phone calls and hardly even leave my room if it's not for work and school. I didn't even call any of my friends or family when I was hospitalized for mental health, and not because I didn't wanna talk to them. Everything about phone calls stresses me out - i don't understand what times of day it's okay to call, how many times to try, what to leave in a message if I don't get through, when or how to end a call, etc - but a lot of family has said that just texting this kind of stuff feels rude.\n\nSince it seems like it's agreed that IATA here, at least specifically for mother's and father's day, I really have to wonder exactly how far out into my family I should be expected to do things? In-laws, family members that haven't really treated me or others well, family I barely know, just kind of everyone? I have a really big extended family, not counting in-laws, and feel like it would be unreasonable to get everyone presents or cards or call every single person or remember every birthday even for people I've only met once but who means I wouldn't be alive if they didn't have kids. I also am worried that if I gave concession here they'll take that to mean okay I'm doing everything now, not just this one thing.",

    "body": "This happened two years ago, but to this day, I feel guilty. Long story short, I grew up with Ted, my ex-best friend of about 12 years. \n\nTed and I felt more like brothers than anything else. I trusted him with everything in my life, and he did the same with me. He ended up moving abroad and meeting his current girlfriend who I'll call Melissa. \n\nMelissa seemed great at first. She was really nice to me and Ted and other mutual friends. After months of dating, Melissa made me really uncomfortable. She added me on all of my social media accounts and started sending me private messages, asking if I was online to talk. I told Ted about these messages, and he said she was just trying to be nice.\n\nOnce when I was online, she started messaging me, telling me intimate details about arguments she had with Ted. She wanted my advice. I told Ted all about this, and he just blew it off. The messages got so weird, I ended up telling Ted that her messages were getting too intense. \n\nGuess what? He told her everything I said. After this, she started spamming my facebook with messages calling me a cuck, a fag, and other slurs just because I didn't want her messaging me. I showed everything to Ted, and he didn't defend me or stand up to her. She kept sending me abusive messages until he finally \"talked\" to her about it. \n\nEventually, I told Ted I didn't want to be friends with him anymore if he was going to let his GF ruin our friendship. He told me I was overreacting and didn't understand why I was ending our friendship. After this, I never talked to him again.\n\nJust a few days ago, a mutual friend of ours told me Ted still hates me because I \"abandoned\" him over something stupid. AITA for ending this friendship?\n\ntl;dr ... best friend of years gets a gf who harrassed me on social media. When I told him I didn't want to be friends anymore, he said I was overreacting.\n\nUpdate: The messages she sent me mostly bashed Ted and his shortcomings in their relationship. They also mentioned other private aspects of their lives that weren't any of my business knowing. I did tell her these messages made me uncomfortable and that I didn't really know how to respond to her comments. She kept sending me messages even after this, though. I also only knew her for four months at this point.",

Anyway, I said yes, but asked that they cover the cost of my accommodation for an extra night (as I’ll have to be up fairly early to do bridal prep shots and the wedding is a seven hour drive for me), which they said they would do. A few hours later I get a message from Jesse:\n\n“Hey dude. This whole thing seems to be turning into a business arrangement and really you’re coming as a guest — we want you to have fun and we’re only asking for a few snaps and your food is already being covered. I don’t want you thinking we want loads of pics because we don’t.” I feel like the undertone was that they’re paying for food so they don’t expect to pay for the hotel/accommodation for the extra night.\n\nI sent back a polite message detailing why taking wedding photos take so much work and pointing out that I don’t want them or me to feel bad after the fact because I wasn’t 100% on the ball and have heard nothing back and word on the grapevine is I’ve ruffled some feathers. I feel really hurt because a hotel room costs roughly $150 and clearly, they don’t even think my work is worth that much, which was a bit of a blow to my ego.\n\nThat being said, I feel like a $2,000 wedding photography package is a gift in itself and I shouldn’t have to fork out an extra night for a hotel room, but part of me is wondering if I should have just avoided saying anything at all.

    "body": "So about six or 7 years ago I decided to take over cooking and shopping duties for my household of 5.  Long before I took over, and for a few years after, the grocery store had your [traditional style checkout stands]( http://i.imgur.com/zpUTnLW.jpg) where the cashier would take your items from the first conveyor (which you typically loaded yourself), scan them, then place them on a second conveyer that would go to a bagger at the end of the stand who would then load your cart.  Practically every lane with the exception of the express lanes was set up like this.  \n\nA couple of years back the grocery store took out the old stands and replaced them with these updated ones that removed the traditional bagger’s area and replaced them with the carousel-style bagging system you typically see at [self-checkouts]( http://i.imgur.com/cx29l8J.jpg).  I suppose you could describe it as a [hybrid of the two stands]( http://i.imgur.com/wgiNaWm.jpg), and though no one comes right out to say it, the intent seems clear to me; They want you to bag your own groceries.  \n\nThere are maybe 1-2 baggers/runners on shift at the time and day I go, when there used to be about one to every lane.  When they were first installed, it was a nightmare.  Lines were stacked up further back than I had ever seen, customers were upset with the new system and many were not afraid to complain to any employee that would listen.  In the time since they were first installed it has gotten a little bit better, though not as fast as it was before, and I am still not having it. \n\n I don’t mind loading my own cart, but I am not going to stand there and bag the groceries when there are plenty of other grocery stores in the area (even ones owned and operated by the same company) that don’t have these new stands.   Every time I shop I play a waiting game with the cashier; who is going to flinch first and start bagging the groceries?  Not I.  I look over to the next lane and see some little old lady bagging her own groceries, and I know others are looking at me and thinking “Look at this asshole, if she can do it, why can’t you?”  My feelings are not that this little old lady should be bagging her own stuff and I shouldn’t, but that neither one of us should, nor should the judging eyes.  And until the store tells me their intent is for me to bag my own stuff, I’ll keep playing this little game to see who gives in first.  \n\n\n",

    "body": "I stayed in my boyfriend's house last night. We both left for work at the same time this morning, and half way down the road I realised I left my phone under the pillow. He had no time to go back as he needed to catch a specific train so I took his keys and got it myself. The problem then was that we don't work near each other and I would have no chance during the day to return them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called him when I got into the house and offered to hide the keys in a pile of stuff he has in the porch ready to go to a charity shop and he said no (understandable). When I was on the bus I called him again to discuss what to do, and he said I should put them in a taxi to his job. I work in the City Centre and he works out in a suburb and the total cost would be around €25-€30 so I said no. I offered three alternatives:\n\n1. I meet him during his commute home, he wouldn't even need to step off the train.\n2. I could take the bus out to where he works and give them to him if he's staying in the area late.\n3. I could go to his house when he needs to get in, then go home to my own place from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEach of these options would take 2+ hours out of my evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe refused all of these saying they were too much hassle. At this point we started to argue and fair enough, it was my mistake that I needed to go back and I did technically cause this annoyance, but I don't think it's that big of a deal or anything to fight about, especially considering  I'm offering to do all that running around. He won't be home until 6:45 at the absolute earliest yet he's still demanding I get the keys to him by 5:30. This would mean me leaving work early to bring them, or footing that taxi bill. I ended up scoffing about how big of a deal he was making this and calling him unreasonable before hanging up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was thinking about it then, and rang him back offering to compromise and pay half of the taxi fare, he could pay whatever was left when the keys arrived. He said no and hung up. I'm in work now way more upset than I should be, and unable to concentrate on my work because I'm worrying about this simple problem being a huge argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO UPDATE: I put his keys in a taxi in the end. It cost €40. I asked him to tell me when it arrived and he allowed me to believe it hadn't when it had, and I got worried and stressed about the driver potentially scamming me and losing the keys and money. I only found out when I offered to go to the police and his reaction was weird and dismissive. I said \"you have the keys don't you?\" and he hung up. Then I got a text saying they keys arrived 10 minutes before that phone call. I'm fucking fuming at how unneccesary the whole fight was, and how unwilling he was so cut me any slack.

    "body": "Was having a debate with a few people and while I already have an idea, I really wanted to get a general sense of opinions and etiquette. \n\nSo I was on a Flix the other day, not too full, and I had the window seat, with the aisle seat empty. Another passenger was directly behind me, his aisle seat also empty. As it was a night bus, I'm tryna catch some Z's, so I pop the seat back and lean on the window. I feel some knees in the back of the seat but think nothing of it. Maybe the dude was caught off-guard and had his legs crossed, needing to shift them accordingly. So I close my eyes and get ready to slumber, when I get a tap on my shoulder. \n\n\"Can you please sit here, so that you can recline your seat?\" he asks, indicating the aisle seat beside where I am sitting. \n\n#\n\n\"Ok,\" I think, \"He asked politely, and I can see how it would be uncomfortable.\" But at the same time, the seat beside him is available, his seat is ALSO reclined to its fullest capacity and there is no one behind him in the aisle. So I respond,\n\n#\n\n\"If it's uncomfortable for you, you can also move to the unoccupied seat beside you, where you wint be bothered.\" As I see it, I am well within my rights to recline, as is he, to request my switch. But if it bothers *him*, why should *I* be the one to move?\n\n#\n\nHe answers, \"But then I won't be able to lean on the window!\"  Seems like we will both have that problem, and I told him as much. But alas, I did end up moving, but only a while later and only because  I was in a seat directly by the back stairs, where there was a little table and lots of space in front where I could put my feet up. In this position, it was more comfortable to be seated in the aisle. No harm, no foul, I guess.\n\n#\n\nBut who was the asshole in this situation? Does everyone not have a right to recline their seat that minimal 4 inches? \n\nI know in some situations, it's best not to recline. For example, a few weeks ago I was sat in front of a morbidly obese man. I could see it was a struggle for him to be in the seat already, and I felt that, if I reclined, this dude would be absolutely stuck. So I sucked it up for the whole 10 hour night bus without reclining (luckily a seat opened up directly in front of mine and I switched  and slept okay for about 4 hours). \n\nAnyways, I appreciate the responses and feedback. Just want to get a general idea and sense of how folks see this particular etiquette.\n\n AITA? \n\nCheers?",

He kept whining about how he wished he could go up further, (which I understood), and then he just started pouting and telling me that I was just being there with him because I had to. I tried to tell him that I didn't want him to be alone, but he was just wallowing in self-pity, and eventualy ended up yelling insults at me about random stuff. I finally got fed up and continued up the trail. When we came back he was still sitting there, and he sat in silence the whole way home. Was I the asshole? Let me know please, I kind of feel bad.",

    "title": "AITA for being upset with my brother for telling my parents about my drug use?",
    "body": "*Names have been replaced for anonymity*\n\nTwo years ago, my younger cousin James (24) started to dabble with recreational drugs. James lives at home with his parents who are staunchly against drugs. He has always been particularly close with my brother, David (25). David is also not fond of drugs, however his opinion is not as black and white.\n\nAlong with most of my friends, I’ve been a recreational drug user for the last seven years (I’m 26). In no way do drugs permeate throughout any of our lives outside of weekends/festivals and we regularly go months without using.\n\nDavid has always been worried about James’ drug use and has expressed this multiple times (interestingly, he also says my drug use does not bother). It’s not entirely unwarranted as I do agree that James can get a little reckless (I’ve told him to simmer down before too). He’s always receptive and reels it in. It has never gotten to the point where I have been concerned.\n\nRecently my aunty and uncle found out about James’ drug use. They made him promise to never touch drugs again. As we often hang out together, they made the assumption that me and my friends also use. They told my parents about their suspicions who then approached David to confirm them (he did).\n\nMy parents approached me about it two weeks ago which was not pleasant. They’re anti-drug (my Dad’s brother (different uncle) was a heroin addict). It is a part of my life I never wanted to share with them as I don’t believe they will ever be able to discuss or understand drugs objectively.\n\nAs a result of this, I told James we can’t hang out anymore. Even if he stops using, his parents will assume that he still does because we’re hanging out. They’ve explicitly expressed their concern over our fortnightly BBQs (no drugs) and midday study sessions (again, no drugs). The only time they aren’t concerned is when David is also attending.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n* I can't  hang out with James, who along with being my cousin is one of my closest friends\n* James can’t spend time with a lot of his friends due to not wanting to upset his parents further\n* I  dread the idea of spending time with my parents due to the awkwardness of this whole situation (same for my aunty and uncle)\n* My parents think all of my friends are drug addicts (none of them are more than recreational users)\n\nIt’s also negatively impacted my relationship with my brother David as I largely blame him for the entire situation. David thinks that I should apologise to him for directing my anger towards him. I told David that he intentionally dragged me into this to get through to James. He confirmed that along with not wanting to lie to our parents, this was true. He justifies the entire situation as he believes he only did what he had to do to get through to James and stop him from spiralling into drug addiction. I told David that I don’t disagree he is well intentioned, however I strongly believe that his biased opinion of drugs has exaggerated the entire thing.",

    "body": "2 years ago, I was in high school and dated a guy we’ll call F. It happened as a result of us being in the same friend group and was never very serious. I broke up with him after a month because he was manipulative and tried to get me to choose him over my friends. Towards the end of our relationship, F wanted me to wear one of his sweatshirts to support him since he had a soccer game that day. No problem. He told me I could give it back whenever. We ended up breaking up shortly after, and the sweatshirt was the last thing on either of our minds. For 3 months after the breakup, he stalked me. He would show up to restaurants I was at and outside of my house at night and he would look through my windows and text me about it. So I figured the safest thing to do was no contact and blocked him on every platform. He would keep finding new ones to contact me on, and I would keep blocking him. He even had his little sister try to add me on SnapChat and would keep changing his profile pictures to old pictures of us to try to get me to talk to him. I kept with no contact, and things died down. 2 years later, F has made a new Instagram and messaged me to ask for his sweatshirt back. I don’t want to give it to him. I don’t want it. I don’t wear it. It’s not about the sweatshirt. It’s about the idea of having to see him again. We don’t have any mutual friends who could bring it to him. I feel stuck. I don’t want to be the bad guy and keep something that he cares about and is rightfully his, but I really don’t want to get involved with him again in any way. AITA?",

    "body": "Hi assholes.\n\nSo I spend half my time thinking I am well righteous, the other half thinking IATA.\n\nWe have two boys aged 4 and 6. I get them out of bed in the morning, ready them for school, dress, teeth, do homework, make beds, make our bed, sort breakfast and take them to school. She makes their lunches.\n\nWife is up at 5am every morning to go running. Returns at 7am, spends an hour showering and getting ready for work. We both work from home, I am the main breadwinner.\n\nWife fetches kids from school at 5pm and usually makes dinner. Goes to yoga on Wed eve and gym Friday eve, so I cook then. If she is 'out' with her gal pals, usually once but sometimes twice a week, I make dinner. After dinner, I do bathtime and homework, and then I spend an hour or so with my boys playing Xbox or doing puzzles. At 7:45 I chase the lads to wee and get into bed, then I read a storybook and tell them some tales of when I was young. While all this is happening, the Mrs does dishes (I help stack the dishwasher and I always empty it the next morning) or is on her phone.\n\nWife does not involve me or the boys in her sports, actively avoids it. She doesn't like coming with on our Saturday and Sunday walks with the dog + boys, which is hard because 4yo is learning to ride his bike with me pushing, and me also hanging on to an unruly beagle.\n\nSo here's my gripe - I hassle her regularly telling her she needs to be more involved in parenting and she needs to involve  our boys in her sports (she often hints that I should take them to soccer or hockey...but I am a cyclist and a runner and a hiker, and I take my boys cycling, running and hiking). We occasionally have fights over this and she gets very defensive and never admits any fault, but after a fight things will improve for a while as she makes more effort (like taking the laundry off my hands, which does make my life easier).\n\nI have also said to her being up at 5am every morning and out most evenings isn't on; she says her fitness makes her happy and that it isn't her problem if I choose not to go out (I rarely do 'man time' with my mates). I also tell her that she is obsessed with her appearance (she is a very attractive woman) and should tone it down, spending an hour every morning on makeup etc is OTT.\n\nI say she should consider that 'her happiness' isn't the top priority here - I have gladly sacrificed my own in the interests of raising children better, and I have gotten used to doing new things for fun. That aggravates her a lot.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? Bear in mind, the way she will tell this story will probably be radically different, so try put yourself in her shoes. And she is a lovely person, too, we've been married for nearly a decade and together for 15 years.",

He'll also move on to try rubbing my shoulders, or braiding my hair, or massaging my hands. I guess he has a need to 'fix' and since he feels his apology isn't enough he goes into care-overdrive. I'm not a fan of any of this. And he has a really hard time backing off when I say no. I had to have a long talk with him and my friend because if I'm being touched after I've asked to stop, I start to panic and and get really angry (on the inside. He doesn't see this) so I've started to just ignore the apologies in case my forgiveness isn't strong enough for him.\n\nI know this is an anxiety response. I have anxiety too.

    "body": "I'm getting married in a couple weeks. It's going to be small, only 12 guests, so we're having dinner at a 5 star restaurant rather than having the event catered. I met with the restaurant manager a couple of months ago and explained that I was lactose intolerant. She assured me they could accommodate. A few days ago she emailed me the proposed menu for the 5 course meal everyone would be eating. Every item except one looks like it contains dairy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked if they'd be using dairy substitutes, and she told me no, they had a \"separate menu\" planned for me. I don't want to be an asshole or a bridezilla, but I am honestly baffled and annoyed. If they have to plan a separate menu anyway, why not just make the entire thing without dairy? Is it really easier to do two separate 5 course meals?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some context, I am not dairy free by choice, and I was not born this way. I developed the intolerance about 4 years ago. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese, creamy sauces, ice cream, all things dairy.  The \"actual\" menu the restaurant manager sent me looks amazingly delicious, and I don't want to be staring enviously at what everyone else is eating. If it weren't my own wedding, I'd suck it up and be grateful someone accommodated my issue. However, this is going to be an expensive dinner and it's my own freakin' wedding! My fiancé is very supportive and has given up dairy with me except for the occasional pizza. Would I be a selfish bridezilla if I asked the restaurant to serve everyone this \"separate menu,\" whatever it is?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for not letting my guests enjoy the dinner the restaurant has planned for them? Thank you for any feedback! I have not yet decided whether to make an issue out of this or just let it go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I agree that I WBTA if I were restricting everyone from ordering what they wanted off the restaurant's normal menu. This is going to be a pre-set 5 course dinner. Salad, App., Entree, 2 desserts. Everyone has the same thing (but could opt out of one or two if they didn't like it). It's not going to be a normal catered wedding where you have 3 or 4 options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Since people are asking, I don't know what the \"separate\" menu is. The restaurant manager hasn't emailed it (yet?). I think that's mainly why I'm upset. If this restaurant is as good as I've been told, the non-dairy menu should be great too, but it seems like they've focused all their energy on the \"main\" menu, so I don't know.",

So, here goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd been in a kinda long-term online relationship with this guy, to the point where we were pretty comfortable with each other, and had visited several times.  He ended up having a nervous breakdown over school stuff, and in general hating the state he lived in, so I offered to let him move in with me.  I wasn't really worried about any of this, as I'd been self-sufficient for a good year or so.  He took me up on the offer and moved in, and we renewed the lease on my place with both of us signing on it.  Things were good for a while, until a few months later when he broke up with me.  He wants to still remain friends, but a few things are getting in the way of that for me.  For one, there's only one bedroom in my apartment, so we still sleep in the same bed, and the somewhat small area we live in means I'm around him quite a lot.  It's very hard for me to get over him when I'm around him so much.

I've come to the pretty firm realization that, even though he has been helping with rent which is a nice boost to my budget, I would kind of rather live alone if I'm not going to be living with someone I'm romantically involved with.  The thing that's making this complicated for me is that he has no local friends, and relies on me entirely for his social health.  A big part of me would honestly feel bad leaving him to fend for himself since I was the one that suggested he move here in the first place.

Sitting near the dance floor at the bar was a small group of girls, one of whom was very clearly upset, had been crying, etc. It felt a little weird but they weren’t in the dance floor and so my friends and I decided to be idiots and start dancing. While we were dancing I still had a full drink so I put it down at bar, relatively near the girls but not in front of them. Next thing I knew the girl threw the entire drink all over my back. \n\nI was pretty pissed in the moment because I was so shocked, but my immediate reaction was to say “what the fuck.” As I turned around the girl who threw my drink on me was already being ushered out of the bar by a couple of friends and she was sobbing. Two other girls apologized profusely to me and told me she was going threw a divorce and had been talking all night about how guys are evil and she’s done with men. They apologized and I calmed down, but I also added that it definitely sucks she’s going through a divorce but that doesn’t really excuse her behavior. I asked them to buy me a new drink and they had some excuses but basically the answer was no. I sort of stood my ground and said that it’s the right thing to do to buy me a new drink since it was sort of an expensive drink and the girl who wasted mine had already left. The girls once again said no and one of them actually made a comment saying it was rude that I was not being understanding. \n\nThe girls left without paying for my drink and my girlfriend was on my side (she kept calling them bitches) but a couple of my girlfriends friends were saying that I need to calm down and that I’m not being understanding. I was definitely mad, but I never raised my voice. They said I was being rude to her and her friends and that I should have a heart for not considering her feelings. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: should probably clarify; when I said my girlfriend was calling them bitches I meant later on after the fact, not to their faces.

The only reason he didn't hit me was because my mom got between us. Right then and there I knew I didn't want anything to do with him anymore.\n\nI was to move out of the house to another town for school two weeks later. My father works in another town during the week so he isn't home until the weekend. When my mom and I were alone that week, I told her I wasn't coming home that weekend. I literally feared for my life at this point. I went to my boyfriend's house for the weekend. (I was now to move out in a week).\n\nBy Monday, I decided to stay another day, just to be sure. I got a call from my mom saying that my dad was MAD and that I needed to come home. She came to get me and in the car ride back home told me everything he told her during my little escape. He called her stupid, a whore and all types of other names for allowing this. He talked about her dad, who died when she was four, and said he was lucky to have never met her because she's so stupid.\n\nWhen we got home, my father scremed at me and insulted my mother in front of me. He wouldn't stop insulting my relationship with my boyfriend. We'd been togheter for only a month. I learned that his entire tantrum was basically because he didn't approve my relationship. (I'm still a minor and he's 6 years older than me. The age of consent is 16 where I live and I was at least that, so nothing illegal). After I argued with him for quite a while, everything settled down and he started crying that he lost his last weekend with his babygirl. I thought it was the end of it.\n\nBoy was I wrong! That night, while I was in my room with my sister, we heard my parents screaming at each other in the kitchen. My father ended up kicking my mom out of the house, followed by my sister who always hated him. I called my boyfriend to get me, wrote my phone number on a board downstairs in case my father would want to talk. \n\nThe only time I went back that week was on Saturday, so that my mom could finish moving me and my stuff to my apartment.\n\nThe next weekend, when I went back, my mom was back with my father and everyone acted like nothing happened.\nI no longer stay in their house and everytime I'm in my hometown, I stay with my boyfriend. When I'm to their house, I act like everything is fine because I don't want to cause a scene. I don't want to have anything to do with him and he is no longer the boss of me.\n\nAm I the asshole for not forgiving my father when everyone else did?",

I’m still not sure about this situation, as my friends seem to disagree on it. \n\nSo up until this incident, I (15f) was not having a good day. We were on a field trip to a museum, and I was stuck in a group with two people that I can’t stand. The day was long and boring, and I hadn’t had breakfast (this is important). At the end of the trip, the two people I didn’t like didn’t show up at the group’s assigned meeting place. \n\nThe teachers let everyone go to the buses but my group. They made us wait for these two for twenty minutes until they were finally found and our group had to walk to the bus, in front of everyone that “we” had held up. \n\nWe got on, and as I went to my seat, where I had left my lunch, I noticed that my lunch was gone. I asked everyone around me, then went up to the front of the bus, where all the teachers were, and asked if any of them had seen it. The bus driver said “okay, sit down.” Here’s how it went after that:\n\nMe: can I check the trash can?\nBus driver: just sit down. \nMe: please, it will only take a second. \nBus driver: Can’t you just check when we get back? Sit down. \nMe: No! I’m not sitting down until I find my lunch \n\nMe looking for my lunch and talking to the bus driver took about 5 minutes, holding up the bus even longer. \n\nShe didn’t say anything and just started the bus, and I had to sit down. \n\nSo, AITA here?",

Two of my roommates last night were drinking and laughing in the kitchen area and my room, which is close to the kitchen, and the apartment in general has really thin walls and I could hear everything. Not just the inaudible sound of people talking but like I could hear their conversations and what they said clearly. Earbuds only help muffle a little bit. I tried to ignore it but around midnight I was fed up and texted them in our group chat if they could be quieter. \n\nThen they were quiet and I drifted off until I woke up again to the sound of laughter at 2:30 am. This time I was really annoyed so I sent some snippy texts that were “can u guys at least whisper, it’s 2am”\n\nI felt really bad at being snippy and this morning made me feel worse when one roommate confronted me and asked “how I was doing.” I was honest and said Im still stressed, I didn’t sleep well last night. \n\nThen my roommate said “Yeah i understand well my room is really close to the kitchen too (hers is next to mine) but i don’t really say anything” which made me feel bad like I should’ve tried harder to suck it up or something. Like I guess it’s true that I’m sure everyone has had to deal with stuff like this at some point but they don’t really complain, it’s mostly just me. Then she said “I was really stressed last week too, last night was like my way of stress relief.” Which also made me feel like an asshole for getting in the way of that and making her feel guilty, but I also feel like sleep is a necessity and there are other ways to relieve stress besides drinking. \n\nIDK. She apologized but it was just like “sorry, but I can’t promise not to do it again because it’ll probably happen again but we can try.” which to me felt like a really half assed apology and really only said so after I said I slept really poorly. I mean I probably apologized more for being annoying bc I felt guilty. \n\nI really have no idea if I’m TA here for complaining. Like it was a Friday night so it’s not like I had to wake up too early but at the same time I’m sitting here with a headache because I wasn’t able to sleep well (I can’t really sleep in because another roommate is usually up or back early around 8-9am and her movements in the kitchen wake me up). But at the same time I guess it’s mostly a me problem since I’m always the one complaining. IDK. I haven’t really been able to afford a white noise machine but maybe I should start to save up and invest in one. I just wish they were more considerate.",

    "body": "When I was 21, I broke up with my boyfriend and moved into my first apartment on my own. A friend of mine had four cats and a dog and was desperately attempting to re-home two of her five year old cats due to her impending relocation. I offered to take them because it was lonely in my place by myself, I wanted a cat, plus I already knew hers. She had two rules: 1. Never declaw and 2. If I have to re-home, they come back to her. I adopted them and kept one for 9 years (he wound up passing away from kidney failure after a lifetime struggle with struvite crystals) and the other for 11 years. I moved apartments 8+ times with the cats, including taking them with me from West to East coast. When I was relocating back to the West coast, I would be crashing on a friend's couch who had two indoor/outdoor cats and mine had been indoor only for 16 years at that point (she was also very tiny when born and weighed about 7 lbs, failing eyesight  and possible hearing loss - it would've been bad to start letting her go outside at that point but I wouldn't have had control). I chose to rehome her back with my friend, driving to Kansas to drop her off before continuing to CA alone. She passed away less than two years later. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been five years since I had a pet, three of them I've been set up comfortably in my own apartment. I've declined mostly because I felt guilty about rehoming my pet instead of keeping her and have been pretty open about that. Over the weekend, I sat with a friend's foster kitten sleeping on me for a little over an hour. I'm down to take this cat and I told her so. She's been a bit elusive, so I met her for lunch today to see if I could figure out why. She told me I'm not a good candidate because I've already given away a cat, so I should exclusively foster only instead of looking to adopt. AITA for rehoming my cat?

It's a tough market.  Anyway, I digress.  My friend interviewed at this place and \\*has an offer\\* from them.  I asked her if she had an e-mail or knew who I could contact, and she provided that information.  So I e-mailed them and got a call a couple of days later to schedule an interview.\n\nShe asked if I told this person that I got his e-mail from her.  I didn't.  He said it was his personal e-mail and he wasn't sure how I got it, \\*but\\* he didn't ask AND I didn't tell.  He just proceeded to tell me about the position, and how they are hiring for all positions (FT/PT/PRN) at the moment.  He told my friend (when she interviewed over a week ago) that they weren't hiring anyone else.  Well, my friend spoke to this contact person today because apparently, she has not yet given them their decision on whether or not she accepts.  She is still waiting to hear back from another place that is basically her dream job, and asked if she could have until Monday or Tuesday.  Well, I guess this person sounded a little irritated and wants her decision by today.  Personally, I don't think this has anything to do with me, because she \\*has an offer\\*, and I don't.  I still need to interview.  \n\nShe said I should have waited, blah blah blah, I thought you were my friend, and didn't think I would have e-mailed them so quickly.  But see...she could have told me to wait, or not give me the e-mail at all, and I would have respected that!  I also saw this position on Indeed some time ago, but when I found out she applied and was in the process of scheduling an interview, I held off, out of respect to her as a friend because I knew she was desperately looking for a job and I have one.  I told her I would wait to contact them until after she got an offer.  Well, she got an offer, so I thought it was okay for me to go ahead and proceed.\n\nIt's not like I'm stealing this position away from her.  She already has the damn offer, and they need her decision.  I have no offer, just an interview scheduled in about a week.  Am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*Update*\nFrom her:\n\n“On Thursday night, I told him that I would let him know by Sunday and I let him know this morning via text and he hasn’t responded. My theory is that he wanted me to accept the offer right away but I didn’t, so he got frustrated and he received an email from you and decided to go for you because you have better experience than me. Really, you have better resume than mine. You have the EXPERIENCE!  My point is you know you are better off than me as far as job marketing goes and you came in in the middle of my job offer and made him change his decision. That’s my theory. I am pretty sick at myself and what I am telling you because it’s just so something I would hate to do. I am trying to overcome this incidence which will take a while but I know eventually I will get over it and maybe laugh at it later. I wish you the best for your future.”\n\nAnd a theory is just that - a theory.  I still don’t think I’m TA in this situation.",

    "body": "My mother for the last two years of her life, was very sick. She could afford nurses for her palliative care but was adamant nothing be done. Because I don't want my mother's last couple of years be in misery, I decided to leave my career as a HS teacher to care for her. I'd spend all my days there with her, nights at home. Sometimes my husband and daughter would come for the day, too, but I'd say about 85% of my time awake since early 2017 to two months ago was with my mother at her home. When she passed, I was the one who found her.\n\nShe left almost all of her entire estate, including her house, to a charity that focuses on her specific illness. She named a third party as executor to handle selling her house so I'm not involved. I basically spoke to the lawyer in one meeting and was told they'll handle it from there. Her funeral was paid out of her estate. It wasn't a life changing amount of money, only about $40,000 plus the bungalow she lived in.\n\nIt upsets me because she left nothing to me. Nothing to her granddaughter. Ultimately it was her choice and it should be honored, but this isn't how estates are usually passed down. Sure, I got just enough to not contest the will according to the lawyer, but the brunt of it went to a charity I wasn't even super familiar with. Keep in mind I took care of her, every day, for two years.\n\nIt's not like we're destitute ourselves. I could only do it because my husband could carry the family. It doubly stings because there's waitlists for local HS teachers. Leaving my career is one thing, rejoining it is monumentally tougher, even with experience.\n\nI just feel like an asshole that it's affecting me so much. My mother loved me, my daughter, my husband. Why would she give pretty much nothing when she passed? I never did what I did out of expectation, although I would have assumed I'd get everything as that's how things usually happen, you know?\n\nAm I being an asshole?",

I am then given a confusing story of an original round trip being purchased through 1 airline, only for her to realize she had points through another airline with an earlier time she preferred - so she then purchases the arrival flight I received - and says she is going to contact the original airline to see if she can drop the arriving flight and keep the departing flight. \n\nOver this past weekend I ask again where the return flight is and the story keeps changing or there’s some excuse. “Oh I left my charger at home for my laptop I can’t email you the code” or “I bought it through my work email and I can’t access that from home”. Today I asked her to please email the information so my bf and I can make arrangements for travel as well as make sure we are home in time, as we both work the next day. She finally texts me today saying that the new return flight won’t be purchased until *the night before we leave*. \n\nAt this point my bf and I are getting extremely nervous about this trip. I am having horrible anxiety about being there in general, on top of the flight issues. My parents can be very shady. One of many examples being, when I was still living with my parents, I flew back to the state I live in now to visit my bf. While I was away, my parents sold my car that I paid for entirely myself and kept the money. (It was a long line of made up/constantly changing stories and lies until eventually I never saw a dime from it. Very similar to what’s happening now). \n\nMy bf and I have a theory there was no original round trip purchased. My bf is also saying that if the return flight isn’t purchased before we leave, that we should not get on the flight. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I don’t get on the plane?",

We both like the mountains, watching horror movies and we both have our own struggles with depression.  She said she wanted to start out as friends and I thought \"cool, someone to hang out with and get to know.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe traded cell phone # and  took our conversation off of OKC and into texting.  I show her pictures of my two dogs and one cat, we talked a little bit more.  She wanted a full body picture of me, so I sent her a fully clothed full body picture of myself.  I'm still operating off the fact that we're just friends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n This is where things get muddy for me.  She asked if I wanted a full body naked picture of her and I told her that was up to her, whatever she was comfortable with.  So she sent me a naked picture of herself from behind and I did compliment her on her ass.  I assume at this point we were going into sexting mode.  (Yes, I know what they say happens when you assume) So we sexted for a bit and then she just stopped texting me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was last night and I haven't gotten a text from her since and I'm not really the one to just repeatedly text someone until I get a response.  If she doesn't want to talk anymore, that's fine.  I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for going from \"let's be friends\" to \"Hey nice ass,\" and sexting for a bit.  ",

    "body": "Some background stuff. She's technically my ex since we got into a MU (mutual understanding) relationship but that really didn't last long but my friend said MU relationships don't really count so yeah she's technically my ex but not really.\n\nAnyways, after \"breaking up\" I still had a crush on her, and while I had a crush on her she had a crush on another guy, whom I don't exactly trust but according to her he's nice so I'll take her word for it. After a few weeks (or months I'm not really sure) her crush confessed on having feelings for her, so of course she did the same. After that, they were in a MU relationship. Now, before she had a crush on this guy, she and I would talk almost everyday. From morning, take a break since we have school (we attend different schools) and then talk in the afternoons. But after she and the guy confessed, we just suddenly stopped talking. She would try to make small talk here and there but everything just felt *dead* and it didn't have the same energy as before. During the times she would try making small talk with me, she would ask me help for captions for pictures. She wouldn't show them, she would just describe them and such. This happened two times, and in those two times she was just actually asking a caption for her MU to use, but I didn't know about it until the second time since her crush's brother and I are friends on Facebook and I saw his story with a picture that was exactly like the one she described. After that, I didn't feel like we were friends anymore. It felt like I was just there to boost herself in her relationship with her crush and that was the only reason she would chat me. Also I don't know if this is important but, I just don't feel that happy anymore every time I see her name, or when I chat with her. I would lose most of my energy and become bad vibes or not all that happy for the rest of the conversation and/or day. \n\ntl;dr - my crush and her crush confessed to each other, they are now MU. she would ask me to create captions not knowing it was for her MU.\n\nSo, AITA here? Am I just overreacting about the whole situation or no?\n\nEdit 1 - Just to clear things up, MU is basically two people liking each other, but they don't have an official title. In other words, being in love but with no official label.",

The ring cost $5,000 and after the purchase, he now has $50 to his name.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I am truly grateful, I can't help but feel that he's being very financially irresponsible, especially given that he is currently unemployed with zero income. Furthermore, since proposal comes with, of course, the prospect of marriage, I can't help but be concerned that after we are married, all of his debts and poor financial decisions will be transferred onto me. This worries me greatly because he has always been bad with money as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried multiple times to convince him to return the ring, or at least get something less expensive, but all he does is become extremely defensive and accuse me of \"not really wanting to marry him\" when that is 100% not the case. I've tried educating him on the dangers of accumulating interest on debt, and he also just dismisses it and says that he'll get a job and pay it off \"later\" when he doesn't have a job even lined up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can't help but feel conflicted between being grateful and worried that his poor handling of money will get us both in trouble down the line as a married couple.

I work as a freelancer and a great gig came up I absolutely couldn't pass up, a true once in a life time deal. Before I accepted I obviously had to find someone to watch my dog que in my Roomate. He agrees so I accept the gig, the reason I didn't ask my girlfriend to watch him is because we are in university and she went home for the summer to be with her parents so it wasn't an option. \n\nIve since been away from home and my beautiful boy for near two months now and my girlfriend and I are arguing, My roommate has been watching my dog and been doing a very mediocre job at it, he's lost my dog over three times and has left him alone at the home for extended periods of time, my dog suffers from separation anxiety and it really freaks him out if he's alone for more than a few hours. I've been living with my roommate for almost two years now so he definitely knew of the responsibilities beforehand. \n\nnow that all the backgrounds out of the way... since I was away for 7 weeks my roommate was fine with watching him the entire time but it turned out my girlfriend went back from home early and has been for nearly 4 weeks. I asked her when she told me she was going back if she would be uncharge of the dog since its kinda like ours, we've been dating for over a year now. She agreed but I've recently found out from my roommate that she hasn't really been doing anything to take care of him, besides taking him at random hours of the night to sleep with him and returning him right when she wakes up. I called her out today and said I was very disappointed because I expected her to take more initiative with my dog since we've been talking about the next steps in our relationship and moving in together I figured that she should care for my dog as much as I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: had someone watch my dog for 2 months, girlfriend hasn't been helping much at all.",

    "body": "Several years ago (2011) I was at a bar and ran into a guy I'd gone to high school with. We chatted for a few minutes, no big deal. \n\nLater he added me on Facebook and messaged me saying that I'd looked really hot at the bar (I'm painfully average but drunk men aren't picky) and then proceeded to ask me to meet up with him and sleep with him. I told him I was married and he backed off.\n\nLooked at his profile, and he was married too. Creeper. Awww man. Since he left me alone after I said no, I let it go.\n\nA couple years later (2014) he messaged me again on Facebook, asking if we could hang out and catch up. I told him I wasn't into it. He was pretty insistent and then switched gears to talking about being dissatisfied at home, and again blatantly asked me to fuck him. I told him to focus on his family and ignored him.\n\nI had never met his wife when any of this was happening.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago and I'm interviewing for a job and the hiring manager is this guy's wife. Didn't even realize it until she said \"oh, you graduated from [school] in [year], you must know my husband.\" I honestly considered just not pursuing the job at that point but it's a good job, I knew I'd be good at it, she and I hit it off really well, and I hadn't heard anything from her husband in years.\n\nI guess she mentioned it to him because he messaged me again and said \"my wife said you applied, I told her how smart you were in school and I hope she hires you!\" I said thanks. Left it at that, nothing inappropriate. After I was hired he messaged me again to say congrats and I said thanks. \n\nOccasionally he will stop by work to see her and we say hey to each other but he's not weird about it and has made no inappropriate contact with me since 2014. \n\nAfter working closely together for a year I consider my boss to be a good friend and what he did has shifted in my head from \"everyday creep\" to \"tried to betray someone important to me.\" If he made a pass at me now, or I knew he was cheating or trying to, I'd tell her in a heartbeat. But since this was so long ago (and nothing ever happened) I still haven't told her.\n\nI have no reason to believe telling her would affect my employment. It might make work awkward but I don't think she would be angry with me. I do feel like bringing it up now could potentially hurt her and their family. \n\nKnowing the ages of their kids and if I'm doing my math right, she would have been home with newborns during the times that he was trying to get laid and that just really makes me mad.\n\nShe speaks of him very fondly, seems very happy with her marriage, and has never indicated that she worries about him being interested in anyone else. For all I know he's never approached another woman like that, or it's something they've addressed and worked through. I feel like it would be insensitive and cruel to bring up something from years ago when she seems happy now.\n\nSo I'm keeping my mouth shut, but I'm wondering: AITA?",

My mom and dad have been speaking about this (of course, my mom not once asking me for my input). She told my dad that I was uncomfortable getting the train into and out of London (I didn’t say that once - the opposite in fact). I understand and acknowledge that London’s a big city, and that there’s crime there - which is why I agreed to meeting my father at Euston. However, that’s all I said. Not once did I say that I was uncomfortable getting on the train.

The group :Me, a coworker, Executive Director (Sharon)and our group President (Steve). Sharon & Steve are both in elected positions, and hold a lot of power in our organisation. Steve is basically my boss’s boss.\n\nSharon was saying how she regretted that she did not invite any trans people to an LGBTQ+ event she hosted. One of our members, Samantha, is a transwoman and she does great work. I love Samantha- she’s kind & funny and is a powerful spokesperson. \n\nI suggested that we connect with her and Sharon immediately agreed. Then Steve jumped in and said: “Oh is that the guy that sits in the back corner?” \n\nThat’s where Samantha sits so I knew he was referring to her. \n\n“She, yes, Samantha is her name- SHE is great, very knowledgeable—-“ But Steve cut me off:\n“ He’s probably got a good perspective.”\n“She,” both Sharon and I corrected again.\n“Oh well I don’t know how to address these things” Steve said. “How do I know if he’s a man or a woman or whatever?”\n“She,” I interrupted for a third time. “She’s a woman- her name is Samantha. That’s what I’m saying.”\nBut Steve wasn’t really listening because he just sort of talked over me: “Okay, okay I’ll just say ‘THEY.’ that way I don’t make a mistake. I mean how can I know these things? I mean- he looks like a guy to me.”\n\nI was flabbergasted. I’m not sure how the conversation ended but none of us called Steve out on being so shitty. And I felt terribly afterward. \n\nJust to be clear Samantha is noticeably a transwoman. She dresses impeccably in feminine clothing (you know what I mean pls don’t word police me!) her makeup is always on point- she is presenting herself to the world as a woman. So I just don’t believe that Steve was genuinely confused about her gender. If he was, he could have corrected himself the first time - instead of continuing on that awful& disrespectful diatribe,  flinging his hands up in the air in this cartoonish motion of confusion.\n\nIt’s especially poignant because we were talking about Samantha in the context of being inclusive so I’m now concerned about Steve’s commitment to our stated values.\n\nI feel ashamed for not saying more yesterday. But I’m not sure what I can do now. I haven’t worked here for long so we’re not yet very close.Many staff talk about his fragile ego and at the end of the day- he is the president. Am I making excuses? I Should have said something in the moment about the power of language &the impact of mis-gendering. I’m considering asking my boss or Sharon to speak with him. But I know that he’ll be offended and will take it out on me. Is that the right thing to do regardless? Am I the asshole for not sticking up for Sam?\n\nTldr: president kept mis-gendering transwoman even after corrected many times. I did not stand up for her or call him out. Am I part of the problem?",

As we alternate weeks, she has asked me to continue the grounding at my place, and when I said that I'd planned on buying him a beer to celebrate turning 18 she said that I couldn't do that while he was being grounded, and I should wait until the month was over.\n\nHowever, I have never set punishments that intrude on her time with him, I've always dealt with them in my week, and also from what she said of the argument, he was right. I know we're meant to be on the same side here but the argument, in short, from her own admission, was that he wanted to do another extracurricular with his friends and she said no because it would take away from his homework time, which I feel is an odd argument given that our son is a straight A student and can handle another extracurricular. The swear that got him grounded was when he said \"I'm not allowed to do fucking anything\", so it wasn't like he swore at her directly.\n\nI'm torn on this because while I feel the punishment doesn't fit the crime, she's also been on my back lately for making myself the \"fun parent\". I have a bit more by way of income than she does so while she has to stick to a shopping list and meal plan each week I'm able to ask our son what he wants for dinner and get takeout every now and again, and our son hasn't said anything to me but she says he's indicated to her that he prefers being with me at my place.\n\nWIBTA for breaking the grounding by giving him his first beer?",

    "body": "For a bit of context, I take a daily walk around my neighborhood, and in order to get out of my apartment complex I have to go across a narrow and busy street.  Visibility isn't great because the street is narrow and takes a lot of twists and turns - it's often difficult to see what's around the bend.  Even using a lot of caution I have had a few close calls with drivers either not seeing me or not paying attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn my way home from one of my walks, just as I'm about to cross at this crosswalk, a man pulls up directly into it, on the side of the road, and parks there.  As he exits the vehicle, I tell him that he's parked in a crosswalk.  I use the calmest tone possible as I know mistakes are easy to make; he could have just not been aware.  He tells me \"I've just been in an accident, go around\".  I look at the car, and at him, and I see no damage to the car or the man or anything serious going on.  I understand that being in an accident is still incredibly stressful and he could have had injuries that I just didn't see, even if he didn't appear to be injured.  The fact that he told me he was just in an accident is what makes me question whether I'm the asshole.  Still keeping my calm tone, I said \"Yes, but you're parked directly in a crosswalk, could you kindly pull your car forward a little bit.\"  There's a large driveway that could easily fit his car about fifteen feet ahead of him.  He continues to refuse.  I get stubborn about it because I think that it compromises my safety and the safety of others if they want to cross.  It seems trivial, but being hit by a car is definitely not trivial, and having to walk out from behind a car parked in a crosswalk, to me, definitely makes crossing in an already dangerous spot all the more dangerous.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI take a step back so that I don't seem like I'm trying to start a confrontation with the driver and think it over.  I see a fireman who's come to assess the accident not far away, who doesn't seem to be busy.  I walk up to him and ask him if he could please ask this man to pull his car forward out of the crosswalk.  He seems hesitant, and tells me I could ask him.  I explain what just happened.  After this, he asks the gentleman to pull his car forward.  He says \"Oh, you'd like me to move forward?\" and quickly does so.  I cross and go home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt might seem silly but the whole interaction had me anxious to the point of shaking.  I've been cycling through whether or not I did the right thing, or I harassed a man who had just gotten into an accident unnecessarily.   So what do you guys think?  AITA?",

The youngest is 17 (Fiona) and just recently got into a relationship with a nice girl in her grade (Jasmine). \n\nJasmine is very nice and I can tell she makes my daughter happy so i have no problems with them being together. \n\nJasmine and my daughter Fiona spend a lot of time at my house, usually playing video games, etc. I’m a software engineer and usually spend time in our computer room which is downstairs.\n\nYesterday Jasmine was over, and  I went into the living room to say hello but noticed neither of them were there. I went upstairs and saw my daughters room was closed with the light on so I knocked and heard some swearing and shuffling of clothes.\n\nMy daughter opens the door, fully clothed, but I could tell she had just thrown her clothes back on in a hurry. I said hello to jasmine and quickly left back to the computer room. Shortly afterwards Jasmine left and my daughter tried to leave as well but I called her into the room.\n\nI told her that while I like Jasmine a lot and am happy for her that i don’t want her having sex in my house until she is at least 18, and that her and jasmine can’t be alone in her room anymore.  My daughter flips out and calls me homophobic and that I don’t respect her privacy. She stormed upstairs and slammed the door shut and refuses to talk to me. \n\nMy wife came home and when I told her what had happened she called me an asshole and that if I banned her from having sex here she would just do it somewhere else.\n\nI know that I probably should’ve set boundaries when they first got together but I want her to be sure she’s making a good decision and I’m worried that she’s not that educated on sex with another girl yet. AITA here? If so how do I fix it ??\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you to everyone who responded just thought I’d update with the current situation and clarify a bit. \n\nThe rules I set for my daughter also applied for her older siblings and they would be the same if she was dating a boy. However I am aware that if I don’t let them have sex here they probably will do it somewhere else which worries me even more. \n\nI sat my daughter down and explained to her that I would prefer for her to be 18 before doing anything but that she is almost an adult and capable of making her own decisions. I made sure to let her know that if she wanted to and if she was happy that It would be fine in my house. Just..not when I’m literally downstairs.",

    "body": "So our family has been going through a bit of a stressful situation that I can’t detail, but it’s been putting a lot of pressure on my husband. So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can’t really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn’t give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.\n\nWe have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can’t exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.\n\nSo I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said “yes thanks!” GREAT! Green light given!\n\nThen I remembered that it’s my Dad’s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn’t care. I asked again, and said “This first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it’s your decision” and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn’t care again. Alright, he can’t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn’t care, so I invited my dad. \n\nMy dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. \n\nTomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me “How about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?” I asked why. He said “The game doesn’t start until 7, it probably won’t end until 9. I have to be up early for work” I said “Okay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don’t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad”. \n\nHis face dropped. He said “I thought that was MY decision?” I said “Well it was, but you just kept saying you didn’t care, and I figured you really didn’t care, so I invited him”\n\nHe stopped talking and just said “k”. I can tell he is upset. I said “I’m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted. I had to make a decision and this was what I decided.” And he just continued to not respond to me (yes this was in PERSON) and then I had to go to work. So we haven’t been able to talk since.\n\nNow I can’t help but feel like an asshole.",

    "body": "English isn't my first language, and I'm on mobile, and autocorrect can be an ass, so apologies for any mistakes.\n\n\nHey folks,\n\n\nI know this might sound like a really minor and nitpicky issue, but it's annoying me a great deal.\n\n\nI'm a student, I've got a part time job of 10-20 hours a week next to my studies. In my country, it's normal (I think in general, but at least as far as I know for teen/student jobs) to ask them to be in 10-5 min before their shifts start.\n\n\nThis is extremely annoying to me. The reason my employer wants me to be in 5 min early is so that the colleague I'm taking over from can inform me about anything I need to know that happened so far that day and to discuss tasks that need to be done. However, the way I see it, if I have to be there 5 min early for that, then that is _work_ time.\n\n\nI try to arrive on time (as in, 5 min before the official start of my shift) but often I end up being there, idk, 2-4 min before the start (I never am at my work station later than my official start time). However, my colleagues will sometimes complain to me that I'm not 5 min early, and as a result they 'have to stay a few min longer to still discuss the stuff with me' (although, this rarely takes more than a minute to talk about). I'm not exaggerating when I say that me being not exactly 5 min early has almost never resulted in a colleague staying a bit later, and in the (max 3-5 over the last half year) cases that it has, it might have been 1-2 min.\n\n\nIm not claiming their time is less valueable than mine. My point is rather that if anyone has to stay longer for their work (be it me coming 5 min early for the shift transfer, or them 'staying later' for the shift transfer) they should get paid for their time.\n\n\nIn terms of monetary impact, I have on average 3 shifts per week I think. 3x5min = 15 min. 15*45(random, low estimate of weeks) =675 min =11 hours. That'd be around 150 euro a year that I'd be missing out on. Might not seem like much, but it's (obviously) mainly about the principle, and for a student €150 is still quite a nice amount.\n\n\nSo, I just cant really be bothered to make the effort to show up early enough to be at my station exactly 5min early. \n\n\nAITA to my colleagues for not always showing up exactly on time?",

    "title": "AITA for pronouncing French words like I would in French?",
    "body": "Hi Reddit,\n\nLongtime lurker, bear with me please!\n\nBackground: I speak French fluently because I went to French school (in the USA, 90% of the curriculum was exclusively in French) from PreK-12th grade. A lot of my friends are French, and to date we still speak in French when we get together(I'm in my late 20s for context). My parents, while not French, live in France, and I visit them at least once a year. I have French extended family. I watch French TV, read in French, and just generally have French stuff happening around me because it has been part of my life since I can remember.\n\nI don't bring this up randomly to people, bc I think that would be kind of douchey to unnecessarily volunteer this info that is irrelevant to my day to day life. However, all my close friends know about my connection to French/France, and laugh at me when I get drunk and can't remember certain words in ENGLISH.\n\nOnto the issue...this past Sunday, I met up with a new(ish) friend for dinner & drinks. Things were going fine, until she asked me what I had done that weekend, to which I replied \"I made crêpes for breakfast yesterday (Saturday).\" I pronounced the word \"crêpes\" the way I learned to say it and the way I routinely say it, which phonetically sounds kinda like \"cr-epp-s.\" She proceeded to ask me what those were, and I told her they were French, thin pancakes that you can eat with butter and sugar (like I did) or with more elaborate fillings. \n\nShe then went on to say, oh, do you mean, \"cray-ps?\" (in the typical American pronunciation.) I said yes, exactly! She looked super confused, then weirdly offended, and proceeded to ask me why I felt the \"need\" to sound so \"pretentious\" when talking about them. I replied saying I wasn't being pretentious, I was just pronouncing this food the way a) it is pronounced by the people who routinely make/eat it, b) the way I routinely say it, since I speak French. She then stated that I should be pronouncing French foods the \"American\" way when I speak about it in America, and not doing so is rude and stuck-up. I said I didn't agree, told her I've always pronounced it that way, then resumed our conversation. Dinner was a little awkward from there on out. \n\nReddit, AITA? I don't feel like this is any different from a Polish-speaking person pronouncing pierogi in Polish, or a Spanish-speaking person pronouncing mole in Spanish. I would get it if I was pretending to sound like I knew the word, but I told her that I speak the damn language! I wouldn't be super bummed if this person didn't become a long-term friend, but I just feel weird about this whole situation.",

My dad knows about this and we often discuss how my work day goes and such. \n\nRecently, a cousin from my dad’s side opened a cafe and my dad suggested that I help run their social media since they would probably need some assistance getting the cafe exposure. I told him I agreed that good social media marketing would help get the cafe some legs to stand on but that I wouldn’t do it for free. My dad got a little upset by this and asked why not? I replied that I would essentially be doing free labor for them, and that I wouldn’t have the benefit of a lot of the resources I have with my job that helps me balance running multiple clients’ social media. \n\nHe said that helping my cousin would be good practice for my job and that if things worked out for them, they could help me get exposure for my work with other businesses; he thinks that would lead to me being able to start my own social media marketing company.

    "body": "I'm on mobile, so I'll try to keep this concise and not include any unnecessary details. Apologies for any less-than-ideal formatting.\n\nMy ex-girlfriend (age 18) and I (age 17) had been dating for a little over a year. It was the first long,  serious relationship for both of us. However, due to her leaving for college at the end of the summer and an agreement that a long-distance relationship wasn't for us, we both agreed to break up. She's a coworker at one of my jobs, and we still got along fine and were generally friendly. I figured it was great that we were still friendly and all was well.\n\n3 weeks after we broke up, one of my friends had a party. My friend invited one of my ex's friends, and my ex asks if she can come too (she knew I was at the party). After giving it some thought I decide that's not a good idea and my friend politely says that since I'm here he'd prefer not to make it awkward and for her not to come. Neither her or her friend showed up, and the party was fine.\n\nAt the party, I became intoxicated and slept with another girl (age 17 who works at the job where my ex and I both work). This was a pretty fucking stupid idea. I think that I don't regret the act, but I very much regret the things that occurred from it.\n\nIt was rather naive of me to assume that my ex girlfriend wouldn't find out about this. A day or so after, I received a text from her asking if I had slept with the other girl. I decided to be completely honest and told her that I had. Apparently she had found out at work when the other girl had told another coworker. She went off on me, saying that I was the worst human ever, that she hates me and wishes she had never met me, and that I should never contact her or see her in person again. I also got flak from her brother, who texted me later saying how stupid and insensitive I was.\n\nWhen I was at the party, I thought that such a thing would be a moral gray area at worst. I figured that I wouldn't really be upset if she did something like that (especially since she had mentioned at work to me that she was already getting hit on by several people), so she wouldn't really be bothered if I did it. Looking back on it, I know she probably still had feelings for me, and that I really offended her and devalued our whole relationship, which wasn't my intent at all. I cherish the relationship that we had and it holds a special place in my heart, and it hurts me to see that in her and her family's mind I pissed away a year of respect and love in an act that occurred 3 weeks after we broke up. This is where my deep regret lies, and it's probably the thing I regret the most so far in my life.\n\nIn addition to a broken relationship with her and her brother, she told her parents about it (who used to really like me), and they told mine. Her parents told my parents to tell me to stay away from both of them, which really stung. I'm facing a lot of repercussions for my dumbassery that I feel like I deserve. My parents are having me resign from my job that she works at, as well.\n\nI don't really know what to think about this. Was my initial interpretation of the whole situation assholeish? Am I an asshole, or is this blown out of proportion? I imagine it's some of both, but I would much appreciate an outsider's perspective as I move forward with this and try to become a better person.",

    "body": "I  am a night-shift employee at a fairly small gas station and convenience  store in a VERY small town (Less than 500 people small.) This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\n\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn't doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\n\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he's done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\n\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they'd BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\n\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I'm sick of M speaking to me like he's my boss, and that he  shouldn't really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn't have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It's not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron's just being helpful so you'll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\n\nWithin this statement,  there's the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don't fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they're meant to slide down.\n\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store.

He does about 3 hours later, I grab a few things and then out the door I was, my oldest brother was there and I told him what happened and he just nodded and let me out the door. I didn't contact my mom for a few days, as to make a point. She never contacted me either, until 2 weeks later. She asked how I was doing and that was that, we made up..

Everything was going ok but I’m starting to get a little upset about how often my in-laws are visiting. They have come up so far in January and February and they also booked two weeks in March, after originally telling us they were coming for one week. I love them dearly and I normally get along with them well, but I do feel like this is a bit of an imposition since they are staying in our very small flat and my own parents specifically try not to come up too often so they don’t disturb our routine (they’ve only planned to come up once for three days).\n\nI asked my fiancé to be sure that they do not come for such a long time again as I feel like it should be up to him to broach the topic with them. He agreed initially that they are visiting very often  but last time I brought it up he got annoyed and refused to discuss it. I have decided not to say anything about March visit to them directly as I don’t want to come across as an asshole who is denying them access to their grandchild- but I’m feeling a bit of resentment here. We Skype regularly and I know the reason they come up so often is because they miss their grandchild so much however when they stay here it severely curtails our sex life (which is just starting to get back on track again post baby)\n\nFull disclosure- they insist on paying for everything while they’re here so my issues are not financial strain. However I feel awkward doing the shopping when I know they are going to pay and I am a bit of an introvert who cherishes my time alone. Help! AITA",

I was unemployed at the time so I said sure.\n\nI went over to see what K needed. K was pretty grumpy and a very avid trump supporter, which my friend did not think to warn me about. I am gay and was living in a small town so this is a group of people I generally try to avoid. K didn't say anything rude to me but I was pretty tense. She basically needed help putting her small business up for sale on a couple local sale boards, would not have taken me a long time at all. She gave me some of her basic information and we planned a day where I could sit down and help her.\n\nThat day comes around, I text K to ask if we're still meeting, she tells me she's busy and to plan another day. This happens one or two times. Eventually I lose contact with her. Then I start a new full time job and am not around my hometown very often anymore. She texts me after a month asking if I can still help her. I basically told her no I am busy with work now and blocked her number, never heard from her again. My old lady friend has never brought it up to me again, so I think she may have forgotten.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? I feel like I could have handled the situation better.",

    "body": "My sister in law has been dating this guy for a couple months. She kept it under wraps for awhile, little hints here and there that she was dating. Had no clue it was a guy I used to work with. We went to her sons bday party this last weekend and he was there with her and the first time my husband and I have seen them together. \nI used to work with this guy for almost 3 years and I know A LOT about him, including some not so good things, one of those being that he’s a bully to women. We don’t get along. \nHe recently got divorced, has two kids, and sister in law is divorced with two kids, similar in age. \nSo when I first started working with him, he was my first “trainer” meaning he was showing me the ropes of the register/store/how to stock etc. He criticized me on Day 2 for “not being more like him and to speak up louder when talking to people,” mind you he’s a grown man and I’m a grown woman. I didn’t appreciate the comment, and nonetheless it created palpable tension from the get go as I simply told him “I cannot be like you, everyone has their own style.” He didn’t like that I responded at all.\nFlash forward to one year later, and another female coworker confided in me that herself and the guy in question has been sleeping together for years. She told me intrepid details that I could’ve lived without, like what his playlist consists of when they have sex-but she was seeking advice in how to end it because she felt like a home wrecker. Mind you-he’s married this whole time. Their relationship is still going today as far as I know, and I know this because I have very good friends who still work there, and see them together all the time. Also, they take trips together, and accidentally give away that they are going together-by giving away details to coworkers of their “separate” trip that they’re actually taking together. \nThe final crux of our relationship ended at work when he came up behind me, leaned into my ear (I was distracted as I had just rung up a customer) and YELLED my full name into my ear. I have VERY sensitive ears, and my instinct was to elbow whoever it was immediately. I didn’t put it together until after I elbowed him in the throat, that it was him and not some crazy customer trying to mess with me. He went to the manager and complained, to which I just relayed my side of the story, and they wrote it off. Didn’t write him up, didn’t really do anything but tell him to stop. Better than nothing I guess. I was livid, and discontinued talking to him for the remainder of my time there while still keeping it cordial saying hi and bye on occasion. \nHere’s my question-AITA if I say something to the sister in law or her mother about him being a bully, womanizer, and serial cheater? My husband has already said that the guy had a bad reputation to his mother, but I don’t feel like that’s enough, without details. \n\nTLDR-sister in law is dating a bully, and serial cheater and I want to warn her of his behavior before she finds out the hard way.",

    "body": "For context, my workplace is a very small (about 100ft^2 or ~9.3m^2) outbuilding, and only accommodates 2 people (three is stretching it) people at a time. We only have about 5 people who work throughout the week, so it’s a very small department both in terms of space and people.\n\nRecently I have been absolutely disgusted by the way my coworkers leave our space. Food in boxes and bags left for weeks at a time until it expires. Drinks untouched after a few swallows. Fresh fruit left rotting in the back room. And that’s just the uneaten stuff. I think I’m the only one who sweeps or mops spills off the floor and cleans off the counters and desk.\n\nI have been asking nicely for everyone to clean up after themselves and to not leave food in the building unless they really need to do so (one person is diabetic) for over six months. Yet everything I listed before was still a regular occurrence. And so I finally broke. I’m tired of cleaning up other people’s messes when they are too lazy to clean up after themselves after repeatedly being asked to do so.\n\nSo I instituted a new food policy. If you leave food in the building after you leave and it is unopened, it will be put on a shelf for you to collect. If it hasn’t been collected or opened by the end of the week, it’s thrown out. If open food or fresh fruit is left behind, it gets thrown out the next day. The same goes for drinks.\n\nI think this is fair, but everyone who works here is saying this is way too harsh, and I am out of line. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I made an exception for our diabetic coworker, since they need quick access to certain foods; they have a designated area to leave their food and drink. And over the summer, we have a cooler with communal cold drinks (Gatorade and water, mostly).\n\nEDIT2: I am the department head",

Apparently, comments about exterminating my people are not enough.\n\nFOB guy takes this as a win and yesterday, he actually rolled closer to clip his nails closer to me.

I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches relatively frequently during lunch, probably about once or twice a week.  Abigail has told me that when peanuts or peanut butter are near her, her face gets itchy and she begins to feel uncomfortable. She says that's the extent of it though, and its not a true allergic reaction.\n\nAlmost every time I’m eating peanut butter, she says something along the lines of “I can feel that you’re eating peanut butter”, kind of jokingly, but, I think, also kind of annoyed. I always apologize and she just says “it’s okay”, but I don’t know how much she actually cares. We have a great friendship otherwise and nothing about peanuts, peanut butter, or allergies is every brought up outside of lunch time.\n\nI don’t want to make her feel itchy and uncomfortable, but I love peanuts and peanut butter is a staple of my lunches.

She also said that she was pushed up against a wall and told that she wasn't wanted (all with a semi smile / semi concerned look). The mother and the rest of the family was there and no one really batted an eye. The step dad wasn't there. On top of this, I heard the mother say in front of the kid that \"you were great until you started talking\", \"go away\", \"I don't want you here\". \n\nI admit the kid is known to be annoying but apparently at school they are very well behaved. It's only at home that they behave 'like this'. \n\nAs all of this was happening I was getting angrier and angrier. I realised that if I didn't leave I was going to say something. I got up and quickly grabbed my things to leave, but on the way out the mother looked offended and shocked and asked if she did something. I snapped and said that what she is doing is abuse, that the kid is being abused.
